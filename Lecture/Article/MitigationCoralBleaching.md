	we found that treatment with a naturally-occurring 289	 antioxidant can reduce ROS in coral tissues and possibly protect the symbiont loss.

	Additionally we found that the photosynthetic quantum yield distribution of A. pallida 314	 symbiont cells had a decline in cells while being exposed to catechin in control 315	 temperatures. This result further shows that catechin, by itself may be damaging to the 316	 QY.

	Being exposed 319	 to catechin without thermal stress may be as damaging to the photosynthetic quantum 320	 yield of cells as if they were exposed to thermal stress.

	For example, we showed that different species can respond differently to 328	 antioxidant treatments. Why did catechin prevent bleaching in P. astreoides and not in A. 329	 pallida? This indicates that there may be underlying differences in the bleaching 330	 responses or mechanisms between the anemone A. pallida and hard corals and therefore

	using A. pallida as a model system to investigate coral bleaching may be misleading.
