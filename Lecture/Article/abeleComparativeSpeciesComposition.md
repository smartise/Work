title: Abstract
color:: 

The community structure of the decapod crustacean fauna of 7 tropical, shallowwater, marine habitats (sandy beaches, mangrove swamps and rocky intertidal habitats on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama, and pocillopora damicornis coral habitat of the Bay of Panama) were examined and analyzed for species composition and relative abundances. Collections from the 7 habitats yielded 4361 individuals, representing 236 species. The number of species per habitat was (Pacific, Caribbean): sandy b e a c h (16, 7); m a n g r o v e (20, 17); P. damicornis (53); r o c k y intertidal (78, 67). There were more species represented by more individuals in the Pacific habitats. An index of faunal similarity was calculated for each pair (Pacific-Caribbean) of habitats. This index is the number of ecologically similar congeneric species which occurred in both habitats expressed as a percentage of the total number of species present in the pair of habitats. For the sandy beach communities there were three Pacific species which were similar to three Caribbean species, a similarity of 6/23 or 26%. The index of similarity for the mangrove comm u n i t i e s is 54% and for the rocky i n t e r t i d a l c o m m u n i t i e s it is 37%. The p. damicornis community has affinities with the Pacific rocky intertidal community (18%), with that of the Caribbean rocky intertidal (16%) and with that of Indo-West Pacific pocilloporid corals (20%). A few specialized species dominated each of the communities. The habitats and the number of species accounting for over half of the i n d i v i d u a l s p r e s e n t are (Pacific, Caribbean): sandy b e a c h (I, I); m a n g r o v e (4, 4); p. damicornis (5); and rocky i n t e r t i d a l (3, 6). M o s t of the species in each c o m m u n i t y were represented by one or a few individuals.
