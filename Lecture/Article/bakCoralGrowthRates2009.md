title: Abstract
color:: 

Linear extension of branches in the same Acropora palmata (Lamarck, 1816) population in Curaçao was measured, employing exactly the same methods, in 1971–1973 and in 2002–2004, and the resulting coral growth rates are compared. Linear growth shows the same pattern over seasons in both periods with growth being significantly higher in summer than in winter. Growth in the 2002–2004 time interval was significantly slower than in 1971–1973. Mean monthly growth ranged from 0.69 cm (winter) to 0.81 cm (summer) in 1971–1973 and from 0.62 cm (winter) to 0.75 cm (summer) in 2002–2004. This means that linear growth rates in 2002–2004 were 7.2% lower in summer and 10.7% lower in winter compared with 1971–1973. Considering possible causative environmental factors relating to these decreases in growth rate, we cannot preclude the possibility that a change in ocean pH could be responsible for the drop in extension rate.

	The length of branches was measured at each data point using calipers and a transparent ruler. The only manipulation of the A. palmata colonies was that a plastic band was fastened around a branch of a colony at a distance of 15 cm from the tip of the branch. The band served as a point of reference for the measurements of branch linear growth. In order to minimize the possible effect of fixing the band, this was done months in advance of the start of the growth measurements. Linear extension of individual branches was measured each month from Oct 1971 to March 1973.
