	also observed that coral color had an important influence on temperature at the tissuewater interface, and Fabricius (2006) demonstrated that dark (highly pigmented) corals (measured with the color chart of Siebeck et al., 2006) could be up to 1.5  C warmer than the surrounding seawater. Thus, darkly pigmented corals, characteristic of turbid or high nutrient environments, might be at a greater risk of thermal damage than their paler counterparts, although this effect might be mitigated by lower light levels and/or strong flow.

	Numerous environmental and physical factors reduce the incidence or severity of bleaching (Craig et al., 2001; Salm et al., 2001). These factors include low light (due to depth, shading, turbidity or cloud cover (Mumby et al., 2001a), high flow (Nakamura and van Woesik, 2001; Nakamura et al., 2003), lower temperatures (Riegl, 2003; McClanahan, 2008) and higher nutrients

	shallow areas subject to both high temperature and high light are likely to be the most subject to continued bleaching threats. Weak water currents further increase the likelihood of bleaching by reducing the ability of corals to remove cellular toxins that accumulate as a result of photoinhibition.

	Where recovery was observed, the dominant recruiting taxa tended to be Acropora, Pocillopora and branching Porites.
