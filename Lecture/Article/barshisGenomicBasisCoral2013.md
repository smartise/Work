title: Abstract
color:: 

Recent advances in DNA-sequencing technologies now allow for in-depth characterization of the genomic stress responses of many organisms beyond model taxa. They are especially appropriate for organisms such as reef-building corals, for which dramatic declines in abundance are expected to worsen as anthropogenic climate change intensifies. Different corals differ substantially in physiological resilience to environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms behind enhanced coral resilience remain unclear. Here, we compare transcriptome-wide gene expression (via RNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing) among conspecific thermally sensitive and thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways contributing to coral resilience. Under simulated bleaching stress, sensitive and resilient corals change expression of hundreds of genes, but the resilient corals had higher expression under control conditions across 60 of these genes. These “frontloaded” transcripts were less up-regulated in resilient corals during heat stress and included thermal tolerance genes such as heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes, as well as a broad array of genes involved in apoptosis regulation, tumor suppression, innate immune response, and cell adhesion. We propose that constitutive frontloading enables an individual to maintain physiological resilience during frequently encountered environmental stress, an idea that has strong parallels in model systems such as yeast. Our study provides broad insight into the fundamental cellular processes responsible for enhanced stress tolerances that may enable some organisms to better persist into the future in an era of global climate change.

	Here, we compare transcriptome-wide gene expression (via RNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing) among conspecific thermally sensitive and thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways contributing to coral resilience. Under simulated bleaching stress, sensitive and resilient corals change expression of hundreds of genes, but the resilient corals had higher expression under control conditions across 60 of these genes.

	The most variable of these pools reach ≥34 °C during summer low tides and exhibits daily thermal fluctuations up to 6 °C (26, 38). Corals in the more variable pools show higher stress protein biomarker levels (39), more heattolerant Symbiodinium genotypes (27), faster growth rates (38, 40), and enhanced thermal tolerance (28). These studies demonstrate that more physically challenging areas of the back reef harbor

	In particular, 60 of the genes up-regulated in response to heat stress in the sensitive coral population show a reduced response and a higher constitutive level of expression in tolerant corals (i.e., they are already up-regulated under control conditions in tolerant corals). We hypothesize that this transcriptional “frontloading” of stress-related genes may be a primary mechanism of thermal tolerance of high temperatures in reef-building corals.

	In other words, these data show that many up-regulated genes in the thermally sensitive MV corals are already expressed at higher levels in thermally tolerant HV corals and that many down-regulated genes are at lower constitutive levels (i.e., turned off under control conditions) in HV corals.

	A reduced heat stress reaction in the more tolerant coral population may result from two potential gene regulatory phenomena. First, some of these genes could have reduced reaction because they begin at a higher constitutive level in resilient corals under control conditions. These “frontloaded” genes may confer resilience through faster reaction at the protein level during

	Beyond the Hsps, a set of genes involved in cell death signaling and/or immunity also shows a clear pattern of frontloading. Seven of the 12 most strongly frontloaded genes (>70% higher expression in HV vs. MV controls) fall in these categories, including a TNF receptor, two hemicentins in the immunoglobin superfamily, a serine protease precursor (plasminogen), a serine/threonine protein kinase, and two zinc metalloproteinases
