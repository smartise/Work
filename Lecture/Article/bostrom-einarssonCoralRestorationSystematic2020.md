title: Abstract
color:: 

Coral reef ecosystems have suffered an unprecedented loss of habitat-forming hard corals in recent decades. While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m2. A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar ‚Äògrowing pains‚Äô as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management. Finally, while it is clear that practitioners have developed effective methods to successfully grow corals at small scales, it is critical not to view restoration as a replacement for meaningful action on climate change.

	Reefs are subject to asuite of chronic and acute anthropogenic disturbances including declining water quality, destructive fishing practices, over-harvesting of reef species, and outbreaks of coral predators and coral disease, however in the past two decades climate change has emerged as the primary threat to coral reefs [2,6‚Äì8].

	Global temperature ispredicted to increase for several more decades even in azero-carbon emission scenario [40,41]. Thus, ifeffective, local-scale restoration action could potentially bridge the temporal gap between large-scale action on climate change and the substantial lag effects predicted for indirect management actions. Given that disturbed reefs are likely to suffer areduction in genetic diversity due to large-scale disturbance events during this period [42‚Äì44], preserving coral species and genetic diversity through active restoration could ‚Äòbuy time‚Äô for recovery following amelioration or the removal of stressors.

	The explicit objective of self-sustaining breeding populations isakey missing component in almost all coral reef restoration projects, and evidence supporting that the objective is met israrely monitored. This isimplicit in the median monitoring period of 12 months which isfar less than the length of time required for corals to reach reproductive maturity. In this review, for example, we found that outcomes of coral restoration projects are largely monitored with biological metrics of corals (e.g. growth and survival).

	While these metrics are important for assessing the feasibility of coral restoration and for refining techniques, ecological monitoring is required to assess the ecological outcomes of restoration efforts and whether or not the initial aims and objectives are met. Appropriate metrics would also enable better assessments of the ecological and demographic processes occurring at restored areas [117,118], and thus inform adaptive management of restoration efforts in the longer term.
