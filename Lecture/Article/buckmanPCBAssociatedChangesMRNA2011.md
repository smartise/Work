title: Abstract
color:: 

Killer whales in the NE Paciﬁc Ocean are among the world’s most PCB-contaminated marine mammals, raising concerns about implications for their health. Sixteen health-related killer whale mRNA transcripts were analyzed in blubber biopsies collected from 35 freeranging killer whales in British Columbia using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We observed PCB-related increases in the expression of ﬁve gene targets, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR; r2 = 0.83; p < 0.001), thyroid hormone α receptor (TRα; r2 = 0.64; p < 0.001), estrogen α receptor (ERα; r2 = 0.70; p < 0.001), interleukin 10 (IL-10; r2 = 0.74 and 0.68, males and females, respectively; p < 0.001), and metallothionein 1 (MT1; r2 = 0.58; p < 0.001). Best-ﬁt models indicated that population (dietary preference), age, and sex were not confounding factors, except for IL-10, where males diﬀered from females. While the population-level consequences are unclear, the PCB-associated alterations in mRNA abundance of such pivotal end points provide compelling evidence of adverse physiological eﬀects of persistent environmental contaminants in these endangered killer whales.
