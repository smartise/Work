title: Abstract
color:: 

Upwelling events can change the sea water conditions within few hours during several months on a seasonal regimen. These events are predicted to intensify due to climate change, exposing shallow benthic organisms to hypoxia and thermal stress, among other extreme conditions. Some coral reefs in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) recurrently experience upwelling events. Coral reefs off Gorgona Island, Colombia, are exposed to lower oxygen concentrations (3.0 - 3.7 mg O
              2
              L
              -1
              ) and lower temperatures (17 - 24춿C) from mid-January to mid-April, when upwelling develops, compared to the rest of the year (4.9 췀 0.7 mg O
              2
              L
              -1
              , 28.4 췀 0.3춿C, mean 췀 SD). While no visible signs of stress have been reported for corals during upwelling, it can be hypothesized that corals would be negatively affected by these changes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) identify the effects of temperature and hypoxia on the metabolic rate (MO
              2
              ) of
              Pocillopora
              corals under lab conditions, and (2) to examine the changes in skeletal growth and Symbiodiniaceae density of
              Pocillopora
              in the field between upwelling and non-upwelling seasons. Findings revealed that MO
              2
              was significantly reduced by 20% at 24춿C and significantly increased by 10% at 32춿C compared to 28춿C. During the upwelling season,
              Pocillopora
              corals exhibited a 52% increase in Symbiodiniaceae density, but the growth rate decreased by 50% compared to the non-upwelling season. Fast changes in water conditions during the upwelling strongly affects the metabolism of
              Pocillopora
              corals. Although conditions during upwelling were not lethal, they compromised the energy of the coral for their vital functions, indicating that upwelling pushes them toward their physiological limit. Consequently, predicted increases in upwelling events in combination with ocean warming and deoxygenation may be particularly critical for upwelling-exposed corals and the reefs they build in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

	Our results demonstrated that the environmental variability that occurs during upwelling events at Gorgona Island has negative effects on the physiology of Pocillopora (Figure 4)

	specifically, cool thermal stress and hypoxia that develop during upwelling result in significant changes in the growth rate, respiration rate, and Symbiodiniaceae density of corals.

	It is possible that Pocillopora corals on the reefs of Gorgona Island have reached their physiological limits and rely on trade-offs to survive the stressful upwelling conditions, as the aforementioned physiological traits did not appear to contribute to mortality.

	In contrast, coral metabolism increased when exposed to elevated temperatures and abundant oxygen. This may explain why Pocillopora in upwelling regions thrive more during El Ni침o events, as warm conditions appear to alleviate the metabolic constraints that occur during upwelling.

	However, the postulated oxygen extraction efficiency under warm conditions could account for the observed tolerance of Pocillopora corals and the resilience of reefs to El Ni침o events in the ETP.
