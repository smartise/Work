title: Abstract
color:: 

It is well-known that the adaptability of coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis to thermal stress varies among coral species, but the cause and/or mechanism behind it are not well-understood. In this study, we aimed to explore this issue based on zooxanthellae density (ZD) and Symbiodiniaceae genus/subclade. Hemocytometry and next-generation sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) marker gene were used to observe ZDs and Symbiodiniaceae genera/subclades associated with 15 typical coral species in the southern South China Sea (SCS). Average ZDs of all corals were in low levels, ranging from 0.84 to 1.22 × 106 cells cm-2, with a total of five Symbiodiniaceae genera, Symbiodinium, Cladocopium, Durusdinium, Fugacium, and Gerakladium, as well as 24 dominant subclades, were detected and varied among these coral species. Pocillopora verrucosa was dominated by Durusdinium (subclade D1/D1a), and other colonial corals were dominated by Cladocopium, but the subclades were varied among these species. Porites lutea and Montipora efflorescens were dominated by C15, and Echinopora lamellosa, Hydnophora exesa, and Coscinaraea exesa were dominated by C40. Acropora corymbosa, Merulina ampliata, and five species of Faviidae were mainly associated with Cladocopium types of C3u and Cspc. In contrast to other colonial corals, the dominant subclade of solitary Fungia fungites was C27, with high host specificity. Our study indicates that coral thermal stress adaptability is mainly affected by dominant Symbiodiniaceae type instead of ZD in the southern SCS. Some heat-sensitive corals, such as P. verrucosa corals, have acquired a high abundance of heat-tolerant Durusdinium to adapt to thermal stress. This could be the main reason for these corals becoming the dominant corals in this reef region. Background subclades analyses showed significant differences among coral species in subclade quantity and diversity. These suggest that numbers of coral species may have adapted to high environmental temperature by adopting various symbionts and/or associating with heat-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae.

	Next-generation sequencing data processing and data analysis 215 Strict quality control and sequence filtration were applied to ensure analytical 216 accuracy. Adaptors, short reads, and low-quality reads were removed by the 217 sequencing company. A paired-end read merger (PEAR) tool was applied to obtain 218 full-length ITS2 rDNA fragments with merging overlapping PE reads to generate 219 ITS2 sequences (Zhang et al., 2014). ITS2 tags were de-multiplexed into all samples 220 in the QIIME platform by identifying unique barcodes (Caporaso et al., 2010). A 221 BLAST Symbiodiniaceae-specific database of ITS2 types was downloaded 222 (Supplementary Materials ITS2 Database.fasta) (Franklin et al., 2012; Arif et al., 2014; 223 Chen et al., 2019). Sequences were assigned to the ITS2 types that gave the highest 224 identity in the BLAST hits (Altschul et al., 1990). To evaluate Symbiodiniaceae 225 diversity and community composition, ITS2 sequence data alignment analysis and 226 OTU analysis were used in this study (Arif et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2017; Ziegler et 227 al., 2017). In addition, dominant/sub-dominant Symbiodiniaceae genera/subclades 228 (≥1%) were analyzed both by ITS2 sequence data alignment analysis and OTU 229 analysis, and the background subclades (<1%) were analyzed by ITS2 sequence data 230 alignment analysis (Arif et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2017). The 231 resulting counts of Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 types were merged for downstream 232 statistical analysis. 233 Inter-species variations in ZDs were investigated using one-way ANOVA after 234 the assumptions testing of homogeneity, normality, and independence. The 235 Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test was used for post hoc multiple comparisons of 236 significant ANOVA results. All ZDs data are presented as means ± standard 237 deviations (SD). Shannon‟s diversity index (H‟), which is based on the OTU 238 framework, was calculated to assess the level of alpha-diversity across samples in the 239 Vegan package by R (v. 3.1.2) software environment (Dixon 2003; R Core Team, 240 2014). The difference of Symbiodiniaceae diversity and community composition 241 among the fifteen coral species was conducted by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Similarity 242 of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages was also characterized using non-metric 243 multidimensional scaling (nMDS) using the Bray-Curtis distance metric after data 244 transformation (Tong et al., 2017). Two phylogenetic trees were constructed, with one 245 for dominant/sub-dominant Symbiodiniaceae subclades (>1%) and the other for 246 background subclades (0.1–1%), based on the Kimura 2-parameter model with 247 uniform rates among sites using Maximum Likelihood in MEGA 6 and Bayesian 248 inference in MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012; Tong et al., 2017).

	This suggests that ZD may not be the most important factor determining coral 382 thermal adaptability in the southern SCS. In contrast, in our study, there were 383 significant differences in dominant Symbiodiniaceae clades/subclades among these 384 coral species based on the results of the Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 sequence alignments 385 and OTU analysis. These variations of dominant Symbiodiniaceae types may 386 effectively affect corals adaptability to thermal stress.
