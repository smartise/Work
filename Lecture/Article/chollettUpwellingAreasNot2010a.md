title: Abstract
color:: 

Global warming is a severe threat to coral reefs. It has been proposed that upwelling could minimise the thermal stress caused by ocean warming, and therefore upwelling areas may serve as a refuge for corals. Here, using 21 yr of satellite sea surface temperature data, we analysed the degree to which the thermal stress experienced by corals is reduced in 4 seasonal upwelling areas with reef development: Colombia in the southern Caribbean, Panama in the eastern tropical Pacific, Oman in the Arabian Sea and Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Upwelling areas do not always offer protection from thermal stress. When compared with nearby non-upwelling areas, upwelling can only provide defence against warming events if: (1) the threat and the upwelling coincide, and (2) this overlap produces a meaningful decrease in thermal stress in upwelling areas. These conditions were met in only 2 of the 4 upwelling areas analysed: Colombia and Oman. In Oman, upwelling decreased the magnitude, frequency and duration of thermal disturbances (identified when Coral Bleaching HotSpots, anomalies exceeding the average temperature of the warmest month, are larger than 1°C), while in Colombia upwelling only decreased their frequency. The protective role of upwelling seems to be limited geographically; therefore, further upwelling areas need to be assessed individually in order to evaluate their capacity as a refuge from thermal stress.

	In the last 100 yr, global air temperature has increased 0.74°C (IPCC 2007), and the rate of temperature change is 2 to 3 times higher than has been observed over the past 420 000 yr (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Although land has warmed faster than the oceans, over 80% of the heat added to the climate system has been absorbed by the sea, the average temperature having increased by approximately 0.14 to 0.18°C per decade during the last 20 yr (Casey & Cornillon 2001, Good et al. 2007, IPCC 2007).

	Lower incidences of coral bleaching and associated mortality have been related to the influence of upwelling in the Gulf of California (Reyes-Bonilla 2001), Mexico (Glynn & Leyte-Morales 1997), Costa Rica (Jiménez et al. 2001), Panama (Glynn et al. 2001), Venezuela, Colombia (Rodríguez-Ramírez et al. 2008), South Africa (Riegl 2003) and northern Madagascar (McClanahan et al. 2007).
