	large number of coral and algal genes have no known function (i.e., are ‚Äòdark‚Äô)

	Proteomes have been generated under bleaching stress in the cosmopolitan genus Acropora.AstudyinA. microphthalma demonstrated that proteins thought to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by symbionts under damaging thermal conditions were not detected in the coral host proteome, but rather were detected in the proteome of the alga [19]

	authors did not identify effector proteins of apoptosis or autophagy in the host, which contrasts with the common notion that the coral host mediates bleaching via destruction of endosymbionts. Instead, they reported expression of host synaptotagmin, vSNARE, and tSNARE proteins, and posited that A. microphthalma may employ an exocytotic mechanism to eject the symbionts [19].

	In coral, this plasticity may provide a capacity to acclimate to changes in the environment, but the interactions between plasticity and evolutionary adaptation are not clear and thus more investigations into the role of epigenetic mechanisms in enhancing coral resilience are needed (reviewed in [24]).

	The trend emerging from experiments that bisulfite sequence corals and other invertebrates is that they have comparatively sparse methylation relative to vertebrates.

	Notably, this study combined methylation and transcriptomic data to reveal that gene-body methylation was positively correlated with gene expression and that methylated genes displayed reduced transcriptional variability [9].

	Thepresenceofepimutationsas drivers of divergent phenotypes has also been investigated in the Caribbean acroporid A. palmata. Here, a relatively small portion of the phenotypic variance was assigned to variation in DNA methylation linked to microenvironmental differences [25].

	To further test these hypotheses, it should be possible to experimentally modify the epigenetic state of corals using CRISPR/Cas9 by knocking out chromatin modifiers and/or directly modifying the epigenetic state with dCas9 fused to chromatin modifiers [26]

	Although studies documenting changes in DNA methylation patterns in response to changes in environmental conditions exist [24,27], only recently has evidence for transmission of such modifications between parent and offspring been examined in corals (in this case, in the brain coral Platygyra daedalea)[28].

	Plasticity that has been transmitted across generations [i.e., cross-generational plasticity (CGP)] has been documented in the larvae [29] and juveniles [30]of the brooding coral Pocillipora acuta. This species is expected to exhibit CGP based on the close connection between parents and offspring during brooding and the high correlation between parent and offspring environment during the rapid settling process [31],

	It remains a largely open question whether and to what degree coral adaptation to climate changes will involve epigenetic changes.

	This high cost is driving a search for alternative sequencing approaches, such as methylation-enrichment MeDIP and MBD-seq [24]. In addition, improvements in Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies may have the potential to avoid the harsh conditions and high cost of bisulfite treatment while retaining single-base-pair resolution [32].

	This process involves the identification (using epigenetics) and cultivation of well-acclimatized individuals under stressful conditions. These hardened corals could be introduced into natural populations for the long-term goal of propagating selected epigenotypes.

	These studies typically use a generalized linear model to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and various test conditions to characterize the animal response to various environmental conditions [7,18,34‚Äì36].

	Major DEGs associated with the heat and bleaching responses are transcription factors (e.g., heat shock transcription factor 1 that regulates heat-shock protein expression [18]), genes involved in the UPR [7,38], genes that putatively respond to ROS production presumably by the algal symbiont or the coral host [39], and genes in various signaling pathways implicated in stress, such as the Ras (small GTPases), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B (PI3K‚ÄìAkt) families [18].

	One solution would be a concerted community effort to generate multiomics datasets that are as comparable as possible (e.g., by using standardized heat-stress protocols) in a small number of model coral species that reflect the biodiversity on reefs. This type of resource should identify similarities and differences between model corals and will serve as a solid foundation for comparing other coral populations and species.
