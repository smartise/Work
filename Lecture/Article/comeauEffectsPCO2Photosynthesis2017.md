title: Abstract
color:: 

The effects of ocean acidiﬁcation (OA) on coral reefs have been studied thoroughly with a focus on the response of calciﬁcation of corals and calciﬁed algae. However, there are still large gaps in our knowledge of the effects of OA on photosynthesis and respiration of these organisms. Comparisons among species and determination of the functional relationships between pCO2 and either photosynthesis or respiration are difﬁcult using previously published data, because experimental conditions typically vary widely between studies. Here, we tested the response of net photosynthesis, gross photosynthesis, dark respiration, and light-enhanced dark respiration (LEDR) of eight coral taxa and seven calciﬁed alga taxa to six different pCO2 levels (from 280 to 2000 matm). Organisms were maintained during 7 –10 days incubations in identical conditions of light, temperature, and pCO2 to facilitate comparisons among species. Net photosynthesis was not affected by pCO2 in seven of eight corals or any of the algae; gross photosynthesis did not respond to pCO2 in six coral taxa and six algal taxa; dark respiration also was unaffected by pCO2 in six coral and six algae; and LEDR did not respond to pCO2 in any of the tested species. Overall, our results show that pCO2 levels up to 2000 matm likely will not fertilize photosynthesis or modify respiration rates of most of the main calciﬁers on the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia.
