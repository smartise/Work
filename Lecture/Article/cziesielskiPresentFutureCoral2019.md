title: Abstract
color:: 

The global loss and degradation of coral reefs, as a result of intensified frequency and severity of bleaching events, is a major concern. Evidence of heat stress affecting corals through loss of symbionts and consequent coral bleaching was first reported in the 1930s. However, it was not until the 1998 major global bleaching event that the urgency for heat stress studies became internationally recognized. Current efforts focus not only on examining the consequences of heat stress on corals but also on finding strategies to potentially improve thermal tolerance and aid coral reefs survival in future climate scenarios. Although initial studies were limited in comparison with modern technological tools, they provided the foundation for many of today's research methods and hypotheses. Technological advancements are providing new research prospects at a rapid pace. Understanding how coral heat stress studies have evolved is important for the critical assessment of their progress. This review summarizes the development of the field to date and assesses avenues for future research.

	A growing number of studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play critical roles in the acclimatization process of corals. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, the addition of methyl groups to specific sites on a genome, and histone modifications, packaging proteins that bind DNA to condense it into chromosomes, are currently severely understudied in corals

	Differential expression of transcripts can be a consequence of changes in DNA methylation distribution in response to stressors

	Hence, changes in DNA methylation sites have been linked to transcriptional plasticity, which may facilitate response mechanisms to a previously encountered stressor

	Although complex gene regulation through histone modifications is conserved in cnidarians (Schwaiger et al., 2014), knowledge regarding the role of histones in coral acclimatization and adaptation is lacking. Epigenetics and preconditioning appear to be promising mechanisms for coral adaptation and survival. However, it requires a significantly greater understanding before these mechanisms can be successfully utilized to their full potential.
