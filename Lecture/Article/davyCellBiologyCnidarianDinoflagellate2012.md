SUMMARY
            
              The symbiosis between cnidarians (e.g., corals or sea anemones) and intracellular dinoflagellate algae of the genus
              Symbiodinium
              is of immense ecological importance. In particular, this symbiosis promotes the growth and survival of reef corals in nutrient-poor tropical waters; indeed, coral reefs could not exist without this symbiosis. However, our fundamental understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and of its links to coral calcification remains poor. Here we review what we currently know about the cell biology of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In doing so, we aim to refocus attention on fundamental cellular aspects that have been somewhat neglected since the early to mid-1980s, when a more ecological approach began to dominate. We review the four major processes that we believe underlie the various phases of establishment and persistence in the cnidarian/coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis: (i) recognition and phagocytosis, (ii) regulation of host-symbiont biomass, (iii) metabolic exchange and nutrient trafficking, and (iv) calcification. Where appropriate, we draw upon examples from a range of cnidarian-alga symbioses, including the symbiosis between green
              Hydra
              and its intracellular chlorophyte symbiont, which has considerable potential to inform our understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Ultimately, we provide a comprehensive overview of the history of the field, its current status, and where it should be going in the future.

	Furthermore, these dinoflagellates promote the conservation and recycling of essential nutrients (206, 391), thus facilitating survival in the nutrient-poor waters that characterize many coral reefs, and enhance rates of coral skeletogenesis (129, 138), thus enabling the net accretion of the coral reef framework in the face of biological and mechanical erosion. In return for these various benefits, the dinoflagellates have access to nutrients in the coral’s waste products, a stable position in the water column for accessing downwelling light, and increased protection from grazers.

	The appearance of coral reefs in the Triassic is thought to be a direct consequence of the evolution of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis (275), while the loss of the dinoflagellate symbionts and/or their photosynthetic pigments from corals (bleaching) in response to environmental stress can ultimately lead to the death of the coral and destruction of the reef (163, 402). Coral bleaching is of particular concern given that the frequency and severity of mass bleaching episodes are increasing as Earth’s oceans warm up.
