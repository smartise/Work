title: Abstract
color:: 

As sea surface temperatures increase worldwide due to climate change, coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent and severe, resulting in reef degradation. Leveraging the inherent ability of reef-building corals to acclimatize to thermal stress via pre-exposure to protective temperature treatments may become an important tool in improving the resilience of coral reefs to rapid environmental change. We investigated whether historical bleaching phenotype, coral host genotype, and exposure to protective temperature treatments would affect the response of the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata to natural thermal stress. Fragments were collected from colonies that demonstrated different bleaching responses during the 2014‚Äì2015 event in KƒÅne‚Äòohe Bay (O‚Äòahu, Hawai‚Äòi) and exposed to four different artificial temperature pre-treatments (and a control at ambient temperature). After recovery, fragments experienced a natural thermal stress event either in laboratory conditions or their native reef environment. Response to thermal stress was quantified by measuring changes in the algal symbionts‚Äô photochemical efficiency, community composition, and relative density. Historical bleaching phenotype was reflected in stable differences in symbiont community composition, with historically bleached corals containing only Cladocopium symbionts and historically non-bleached corals having mixed symbiont communities dominated by Durusdinium. Mixed-community corals lost more Cladocopium than Cladocopium-only corals during the natural thermal stress event and preferentially recovered with Durusdinium. Laboratory pre-treatments exposed corals to more thermal stress than anticipated, causing photochemical damage that varied significantly by genotype. While none of the treatments had a protective effect, temperature variation during treatments had a significant detrimental effect on photochemical efficiency during the thermal stress event. These results show that acclimatization potential is affected by fine-scale differences in temperature regime, host genotype, and relatively stable differences in symbiont community composition that underpin historical bleaching phenotypes in M. capitata.

	there is capacity for adaptation in the coral host (Matz et al. 2020) and through selection of the Symbiodiniaceae community (Quigley et al. 2018), adaptation rates may be too slow to keep pace with the rapid environmental changes expected under future climate change (Bay et al. 2017; Matz et al. 2018), and the adaptive capacity of many coral reefs based on standing diversity is expected to be overwhelmed within a century (Matz et al. 2020)

	Some mechanisms of acclimatization, such as non-coding epigenetic changes to DNA through methylation or chromatin modification (van Oppen et al. 2015), may be passed on to offspring and thus change the response of future generations to thermal stress (Putnam and Gates 2015; Torda et al. 2017).

	Previous work shows that a history of exposure to thermal stress can affect the response of corals to bleaching events (Maynard et al. 2008) even without genetic changes (Brown et al. 2015), indicating the involvement of acclimatization mechanisms.

	In these studies, increased thermal tolerance was underpinned by changes in host gene expression (Bellantuono et al. 2012b; Bay and Palumbi 2015; Ainsworth et al. 2016) and the physiological response of algal symbionts (Middlebrook et al. 2008), rather than shifts in the composition of the algal symbiont community to more thermally tolerant symbionts, known as symbiont ‚Äò‚Äòshuffling‚Äô‚Äô (Baker 2003; Berkelmans and van Oppen 2006; Silverstein et al. 2014; Cunning et al. 2015a).

Baseline values were selected on amplification cycle threshold (CT) values (around 5‚Äì23). CT values were corrected for fluorescence and copy number using the equations of Cunning et al. (2016). Samples were re-extracted and/or re-analyzed if CT replicate standard deviation was greater than one between replicates, or if only a single replicate amplified.
