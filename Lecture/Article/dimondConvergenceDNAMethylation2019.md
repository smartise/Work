title: Abstract
color:: 

Phenotypic acclimatization is an organismal response to environmental change that may be rooted in epigenetic mechanisms. In reef building corals, organisms that are severely threatened by environmental change, some evidence suggests that DNA methylation is an environmentally responsive mediator of acclimatization. We investigated changes in DNA methylation of the reef coral Porites astreoides in response to simulated environmental change. Coral colonies were sampled from a variety of habitats on the Belize Barrier Reef and transplanted to a common garden for one year. We used restriction site associated DNA sequencing, including a methylation-sensitive variant, to subsample the genome and assess changes in DNA methylation levels after a year in the common garden. Methylation changes among the 629 CpG loci we recovered were subtle, yet coral methylomes were more similar to each other after a year in the common garden together, indicating convergence of methylation profiles in the common environment. Differentially methylated loci showed matches with both coding and non-coding RNA sequences with putative roles in intracellular signaling, apoptosis, gene regulation, and epigenetic crosstalk. There was a weak but positive and significant relationship between genetic and epigenetic variation, providing evidence of methylation heritability. Altogether, our results suggest that DNA methylation in P. astreoides is at least somewhat responsive to environmental change, reflective of the environment, and heritable, characteristics necessary for methylation to be implicated as part of potential transgenerational acclimatization responses.

	While our understanding of the function of gene body methylation is only in its infancy, current evidence suggests that it helps ensure transcriptional fidelity, consistency, and efficiency, and may also be involved in alternative mRNA splicing (Neri et al. 2017; Flores et al. 2012).

	Stable yet labile, epigenetic marks like DNA methylation can persist over generations, but they can also be primed and altered by environmental changes. In this way, epigenetic processes are thought to impart environmental ‚Äúmemories‚Äù in organisms (Iwasaki and Paszkowski 2014).

	Environmental memories may be particularly relevant in organisms such as plants and sessile invertebrates because they must weather any changes in their environment. Indeed, there are numerous examples of environmentally inducible epigenetic modifications in plants (Kinoshita and Seki 2014; Iwasaki and Paszkowski 2014). For sessile invertebrates, however, far less is known, and studies are just beginning to emerge.

	Tropical reef corals are long-lived, sessile invertebrates that are thought to be particularly reliant on physiological acclimatization and phenotypic plasticity to cope with environmental variation (Gates and Edmunds 1999; Todd 2008). The underlying basis of this plasticity could lie, at least in part, in epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation (Roberts and Gavery 2012).

	Interestingly, whereas ‚ÄãP. damicornis‚Äãperformed poorly and showed limited evidence of acclimatization to the 6-week exposure to experimental conditions, ‚ÄãM. capitata‚Äãperformed well. This suggests that changes in methylation are not necessarily associated with acclimatization. However, bulk changes in methylated DNA were quantified by Putnam et al. (2016), so it is possible that individual genes in ‚ÄãM. capitata‚Äãunderwent both increases and decreases in methylation to contribute to homeostasis. Indeed, this is the scenario reported by Dixon et al. (2018) and in our study. Here, approximately 18.5% CpG methylation was maintained before and after transplantation despite an average of 2% of loci changing their methylation state, reflecting a combination of increases and decreases in methylation among individual colonies and loci.

	ikewise, Dixon et al. (2018) reported no genome-wide increases or decreases in methylation in response to transplantation, but instead that methylation changed in a so-called ‚Äúseesaw‚Äù pattern whereby changes in methylation among hypomethylated genes were mirrored by changes in the opposite direction among

	However, the significant convergence of colony methylation profiles after a year in the common garden together suggest that methylation was in fact responding to, and reflective of, the common garden environment.

	Although epigenetic variation among colonies was considerably smaller than genetic variation, there was a weak but significant positive correlation between these two variables, suggesting that methylation patterns are at least partially heritable. A similar relationship was observed among branching ‚ÄãPorites ‚Äãspp. by Dimond et al. (2017), and additional evidence for heritability of methylation in corals has been reported by several other recent studies (Dixon et al. 2018; Durante et al. 2018; Liew et al. 2018a). While a full appraisal of the potential for methylation to be involved in transgenerational acclimative responses in corals awaits further study, the reports to date are promising.

	Most of these loci were apparently associated with coding sequences, which is consistent with gene body methylation as the primary form of methylation among invertebrates (Sarda et al. 2012).

	One locus was associated with a sequence coding for a calcium-independent protein kinase C-like. Calcium-independent protein kinase C is involved in intracellular signaling, a biological process that is typically associated with the hypomethylated fraction of the genome (Dimond and Roberts 2016). By contrast with hypermethylated housekeeping genes that tend to exhibit consistent expression across conditions and tissues, hypomethylated genes such as those involved in cell-cell signaling are characterized by their inducibility in response to environmental change (Dimond and Roberts 2016).

	A gene encoding a putative tax1-binding protein homolog was another differentially methylated locus. These proteins are involved in negative regulation of apoptotic processes via negative regulation of NF-Œ∫B transcription factor activity. Interestingly, deregulation of host NF-Œ∫B is associated with dinoflagellate symbiosis in cnidarians (Mansfield et al. 2017); loss of

	Another locus resembled a gene encoding a U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 200 kDa helicase, which is involved in mRNA splicing via its role in the spliceosome. Epigenetic factors are widely implicated in alternative mRNA splicing, which is a major source of protein diversity, and hence, phenotypic variation (Luco et al. 2011). DNA methylation itself has been identified as a modulator of alternative splicing (Lev Maor et al. 2015).

	The last mRNA-associated locus coded for a putative FAM98A protein. These proteins have numerous associated biological processes, including positive regulation of cell proliferation and gene expression. However, the most intriguing function involves protein methylation. A study of human colorectal cancer found that FAM98A was required for expression of an arginine methyltransferase (Akter et al. 2017). Protein methylation has been widely studied in histones, and there is ample evidence for epigenetic crosstalk between methylated DNA and methylated histones (Du et al. 2015).

	Further evidence of epigenetic crosstalk in the loci responsive to transplantation is suggested by two loci associated with putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Along with DNA methylation and histone modifications, ncRNAs are considered part of the epigenetic machinery. ncRNAs are considerably more abundant than mRNAs and play numerous roles, particularly in processes such as post-transcriptional mRNA silencing (Kornienko et al. 2013). In some cases, they are involved in directing DNA and histone methylation patterns (Kornienko et al. 2013; Miska and Ferguson-Smith 2016).
