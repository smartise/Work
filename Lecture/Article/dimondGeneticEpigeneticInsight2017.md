title: Abstract
color:: 

Incongruence between conventional and molecular systematics has left the delineation of many species unresolved. Reef-building corals are no exception, with phenotypic plasticity among the most plausible explanations for alternative morphospecies. As potential molecular signatures of phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic processes may contribute to our understanding of morphospecies. We compared genetic and epigenetic variation in Caribbean branching Porites spp., testing the hypothesis that epigenetics‚Äîspecifically, differential patterns of DNA methylation‚Äîplay a role in alternative morphotypes of a group whose taxonomic status has been questioned. We used reduced representation genome sequencing to analyse over 1,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and CpG sites in 27 samples of Porites spp. exhibiting a range of morphotypes from a variety of habitats in Belize. We found stronger evidence for genetic rather than epigenetic structuring, identifying three well-defined genetic groups. One of these groups exhibited significantly thicker branches, and branch thickness was a better predictor of genetic groups than depth, habitat or symbiont type. In contrast, no clear epigenetic patterns emerged with respect to phenotypic or habitat variables. While there was a weak positive correlation between pairwise genetic and epigenetic distance, two pairs of putative clones exhibited substantial epigenetic differences, suggesting a strong environmental effect. We speculate that epigenetic patterns are a complex mosaic reflecting diverse environmental histories superimposed over a relatively small heritable component. Given the role of genetics in branching Porites spp. morphospecies we were able to detect with genomewide sequencing, use of such techniques throughout the geographic range of these corals may help settle their phylogeny.

	In other cases, supposed ecomorphs of the same species have turned out to be sibling species (Knowlton, Weil, Weigt, & Guzm an, 1992), and genetic data have also uncovered cryptic species among similar growth forms of what was thought to be a single species (Keshavmurthy et al., 2013; SchmidtRoach et al., 2013).

	Epigenetic processes are increasingly recognized as molecular signatures of phenotypic variation (Duncan, Gluckman, & Dearden, 2014). DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic mark, involves the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine, most commonly in the context of a CpG dinucleotide pair

	Unlike the DNA sequences of the genome itself, which change relatively little during an individual‚Äôs lifetime, genome DNA methylation patterns are not fixed and can be influenced by environmental stimuli

	Based on the lack of consensus among previous studies concerning the taxonomic status of branching Porites spp., and hypotheses that phenotypic plasticity might underlie this incongruence, we did not anticipate finding strong genetic differentiation, and we hypothesized that epigenetic patterns might prove more informative. Instead, patterns of DNA methylation were less conclusive than genetic patterns.

	This could reflect divergence of the methylome due to environmental effects. Methylation levels in corals have recently been shown to be at least partially under environmental influence over short time scales (Putnam, Davidson, & Gates, 2016). Clearly, the methylation patterns we observed in Porites spp. exhibit some unexplained variance, and this may reflect the diverse habitat conditions and environmental histories experienced by the corals analysed here; the factors depicted in Figure 5 illustrate this complexity, and yet

	hese represent only a fraction of the factors that could influence the methylome. For example, we did not account for coral age, and methylation is known to change with age in numerous taxa, including invertebrates (e.g., Lian et al., 2015).
