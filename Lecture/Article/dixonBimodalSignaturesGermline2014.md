title: Abstract
color:: 

Background: In invertebrates, genes belonging to dynamically regulated functional categories appear to be less methylated than ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù genes, suggesting that DNA methylation may modulate gene expression plasticity. To date, however, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis across different natural habitats has been lacking.
Results: Gene expression profiles were generated from 30 pairs of genetically identical fragments of coral Acropora millepora reciprocally transplanted between distinct natural habitats for 3 months. Gene expression was analyzed in the context of normalized CpG content, a well-established signature of historical germline DNA methylation. Genes with weak methylation signatures were more likely to demonstrate differential expression based on both transplant environment and population of origin than genes with strong methylation signatures. Moreover, the magnitude of expression differences due to environment and population were greater for genes with weak methylation signatures.
Conclusions: Our results support a connection between differential germline methylation and gene expression flexibility across environments and populations. Studies of phylogenetically basal invertebrates such as corals will further elucidate the fundamental functional aspects of gene body methylation in Metazoa.

	For sessile organisms such as plants and corals, plasticity is predicted to be of particular importance, as these organisms cannot migrate away from suboptimal environments [5,6]. In the table top coral Acropora hyacinthus,colony fragments with previous exposure to elevated temperatures demonstrate increased bleaching resistance, suggesting an important role of plasticity in coral heat tolerance [7].

	One possible plasticity-modulating mechanism that is yet to be investigated in corals is DNA methylation [9-11].

	In mammals, the majority (70-80%) of CG dinucleotides are methylated, with the exception of stretches of sequence rich in CG dinucleotides called CpG islands (CGIs) [13]. CGIs are generally not methylated, but can be targeted for methylation under particular conditions [14]. When methylation of CGIs occurs, its effect on transcription is based on the proximity of the CGI to a transcription start site (TSS), inhibiting initiation of transcription when near the TSS but not when far away from it [15].

	In contrast to nearly ubiquitous methylation in mammalian genomes, genomic methylation in many invertebrates occurs specifically on CpG dinucleotides within gene bodies (also called transcription units) [22,23]. Within gene bodies, methylation occurs primarily on exons rather than introns [24-26].

	Because 5-methylcytosines are hypermutable [37], and invertebrate DNA methylation occurs specifically on CpG dinucleotides, sequences that are methylated in the germline are predicted to become CpG deficient over evolutionary time[38].Asaresult,CpGO/E values are inversely related to the degree of historical germline methylation. Low CpGO/E values indicate strong methylation while high CpGO/E values indicate weak methylation. Importantly, CpGO/E has been shown to strongly correlate with direct measures of somatic DNA methylation in a number of animal models [23,25,28,36].

	bimodal methylation is consistent among diverse invertebrate taxa: reported in Hymenoptera [30,31], Hemiptera [33], Lepidoptera [36], Orthoptera [27], Mollusca [29], and Cnidaria [23,28, This study]. Evidence of bimodal methylation in Cnidaria (the sister group to all bilaterians) along with other diverse taxa suggests an ancient mechanism that has been conserved through more than 500 million of years of evolution [41].
