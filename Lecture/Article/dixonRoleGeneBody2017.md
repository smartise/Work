Abstract
          
            Gene body methylation (GBM) has been hypothesized to modulate responses to environmental change, including transgenerational plasticity, but the evidence thus far has been lacking. Here we show that coral fragments reciprocally transplanted between two distant reefs respond with genome-wide increase or decrease in GBM disparity among genes. Surprisingly, this simple genome-wide adjustment predicted broad-scale gene expression changes and fragments‚Äô fitness in the new environment. This supports GBM‚Äôs role in acclimatization, which may consist in modulating the expression balance between environmentally-responsive and housekeeping genes. At the same time, constitutive differences in GBM between populations did not align with plastic GBM changes upon transplantation and were mostly observed among
            F
            ST
            outliers, indicating that they arose through genetic divergence rather than through transgenerational inheritance of acquired GBM states.
          
          
            One-sentence summary
            Genome-wide shifts in gene body methylation predict gene expression and fitness during acclimatization but do not contribute to epigenetic divergence between populations.

	Association	between	plastic	GBM	changes	and	gene	expression	changes	(Fig.	2	F	-	H)	 203	 prompts	the	question:	which	one	is	likely	to	be	the	leading	cause?	The	magnitude	of	GBM	 204	 changes	is	much	lower	than	changes	in	GE	(Fig.	2	D,	E),	which	suggests	that	GE	might	be	the	 205	 primary	driver.

	However,	considering	the	simplicity	of	plastic	GBM	changes	-	genome-wide	 206	 exaggeration	or	mitigation	of	GBM	disparity	among	genes	-	it	is	more	parsimonious	to	assume	 207	 that	this	is	the	leading	change	driven	by	the	environment,	which	then	translates	into	broad208	 scale	functional	shifts	in	gene	expression	(Fig.	2	H	and	Fig.	S8).	In	this	way,	genome-wide	 209	 adjustment	of	gene	activity	could	be	achieved	by	modulating	a	single	process	that	governs	the	 210	 disparity	in	GBM	among	genes.

	Our	results	suggest	that	GBM	disparity	controls	the	balance	between	expression	of	two	 212	 broad	gene	classes:	the	low-methylated	environmentally-responsive	genes	and	highly213	 methylated	housekeeping	genes.	In	the	higher-quality	environment	of	the	Keppel	island,	where	 214	 corals	attain	higher	fitness	(Fig.	1C),	GBM	disparity	change	is	associated	with	suppression	of	the	 215	 environmentally	responsive	genes	and	up-regulation	of	housekeeping	genes	(Fig.	2	F	and	Fig.	 216	 S8).	Conversely,	at	the	low-quality	Orpheus	Island	the	balance	shifts	the	other	way,	from	 217	 housekeeping	to	environmental	responsiveness	(Fig.	2G	and	Fig.	S8).
