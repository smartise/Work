title: Abstract
color:: 

Gene body methylation (GBM) has been hypothesized to modulate responses to environmental change, including transgenerational plasticity, but the evidence thus far has been lacking. Here we show that coral fragments reciprocally transplanted between two distant reefs respond predominantly by increase or decrease in genome-wide GBM disparity: The range of methylation levels between lowly and highly methylated genes becomes either wider or narrower. Remarkably, at a broad functional level this simple adjustment correlated very well with gene expression change, reflecting a shifting balance between expressions of environmentally responsive and housekeeping genes. In our experiment, corals in a lower-quality habitat up-regulated genes involved in environmental responses, while corals in a higher-quality habitat invested more in housekeeping genes. Transplanted fragments showing closer GBM match to local corals attained higher fitness characteristics, which supports GBM‚Äôs role in acclimatization. Fixed differences in GBM between populations did not align with plastic GBM changes and were mostly observed in genes with elevated FST, which suggests that they arose predominantly through genetic divergence. However, we cannot completely rule out transgenerational inheritance of acquired GBM states.

	an elevated Fst means that there divergence in GBM is due to geneteic divergence in the populationand so the difference of GBM between population is not due to a significant difference between them but due to the divergence inside the population itself

	Only the detrimental effect of GBM is well understood: GBM causes hypermutability in protein-coding regions (3). Indeed, in humans, GBM is the primary driver of deleterious parent-age‚Äìrelated mutations (4).

	One remarkable feature of GBM throughout Metazoa is its bimodal distribution among functional categories of genes: GBM is high in ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes and low in genes that are regulated, depending on the context (2, 5).

	It has been proposed that GBM suppresses intragenic transcription initiation in highly expressed genes (6, 7), while other authors argued that GMB simply accumulates in actively transcribed chromatin (8). Still, the correlation of GBM level with gene expression (9, 10) is weak and cannot explain the striking bimodality of GBM among functional groups of genes.

	Most importantly for this study, corals possess the typical metazoan gene body methylation (9) that is lacking in highly evolutionarily derived models such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis (5). In addition, the possibility of clonal replication via fragmentation of coral colonies makes disentangling the effects of genotype and environment very straightforward, solving a major problem of ecological epigenetics (18).

	A. millepora populations (23, 24). From each reef, 15 coral colonies, each representing a single genetically distinct diploid individual (a genet), were halved and reciprocally transplanted between the sites for three winter months (Fig. 1 A‚ÄìC). In this way, each genet was simultaneously exposed to two distinct reef conditions.

	Genome-wide validation of our MBD-seq data was also provided by the facts that the MBD score exhibited the expected bimodal distribution across genes (SI Appendix,Fig.S1A) and showed strong correlation with the established proxy of historical methylation level, the ratio of observed to expected numbers of CpG dinucleotides (Fig. 2D)(5).

	Surprisingly, the change in GBM in response to transplantation from Orpheus to Keppel consisted mainly of genome-wide reduction of disparity between highly and lowly methylated genes: Highly methylated genes became less methylated and lowly methylated genes became more methylated (Fig. 2A, Top). This change was mirrored by less pronounced but clearly reciprocal GBM adjustment in Keppel corals transplanted to Orpheus (Fig. 2 B and D and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Both exons and introns underwent this change (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).

	Methylation levels of intergenic regions and repeated elements remained relatively constant compared with those of genic regions (SI Appendix,Fig.S6C and D). Remarkably, GE changes correlated with lowly and highly methylated gene classes (environmentally responsive and housekeeping, respectively) and were in the opposite direction relative to GBM changes (Fig. 2 A and B, Bottom). Just like GBM changes, GE changes were reciprocal between transplantation directions but were of higher magnitude (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). Although the correlation between GE and GBM was weak at the individual gene level (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and D), it was very strong when comparing broader functional groups of genes (Gene Ontology categories, Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7), reflecting the partitioning of gene functions among GBM classes (5, 28).
