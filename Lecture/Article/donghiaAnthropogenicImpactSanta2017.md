title: Abstract
color:: 

The Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) cold-water coral (CWC) province is a proposed priority conservation area according to several conservation initiatives in the Mediterranean Sea. Part of it is a Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA). Anthropogenic impacts due to ﬁshing on this FRA were investigated using a towed camera system during 2005. The geographic distribution of ﬁshing effort in the SML CWC province was examined through an observers’ program of longline and trawl ﬁshing activities during 2009 and 2010 and Vessel Monitoring by satellite System (VMS) data from 2008 to 2013. Using the video system, it was possible to observe evidence of impacts in the FRA due to longlines, proved by remains of lines on the bottoms and/or entangled in corals, and those due to trawl nets, proved by trawl door scars on the bottom. The application of Generalized Liner Models indicates that the impacts due to longline were signiﬁcantly related to a geographic site characterized by carbonate mounds while those from trawl net were signiﬁcantly related to the soft bottoms, consisting of bioturbated ﬁne-grained sediments. The presence of waste of various types was also observed in the FRA; plastic was the most widespread waste and was signiﬁcantly related to a macrohabitat characterized by the presence of corals.
