title: Abstract
color:: 

The Oceans are swamped with plastic and famous brands are here to the rescue: Adidas, Coca-Cola, Ocean Cleanup and many more. But how does this work and is this really the way to save our oceans? 

We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What can we do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess.
