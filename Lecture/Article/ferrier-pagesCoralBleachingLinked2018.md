title: Abstract
color:: 

Massive coral bleaching events result in extensive coral loss throughout the world. These events are mainly caused by seawater warming, but are exacerbated by the subsequent decrease in nutrient availability in surface waters. It has therefore been shown that nitrogen, phosphorus or iron limitation contribute to the underlying conditions by which thermal stress induces coral bleaching. Generally, information on the trophic ecology of trace elements (micronutrients) in corals, and on how they modulate the coral response to thermal stress is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that heterotrophic feeding (i.e. the capture of zooplankton prey by the coral host) and thermal stress induce significant changes in micro element concentrations and isotopic signatures of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. The results obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the heterotrophically acquired micronutrients and accumulate manganese, magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed corals can maintain high micronutrient concentrations in the host tissue during thermal stress and do not bleach, whereas unfed corals experience a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in the host tissue and bleach. In addition, the significant increase in Œ¥65Cu and Œ¥66Zn signature of symbionts and host tissue at high temperature suggests that these isotopic compositions are good proxy for stress in corals. Overall, present findings highlight a new way in which coral heterotrophy and micronutrient availability contribute to coral resistance to global warming and bleaching.

	The results obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the heterotrophically acquired metals and accumulate manganese, magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in photosynthesis and anti-oxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed corals can maintain high metal concentrations in the host tissue during thermal stress and do not bleach, while unfed corals experience a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in the host tissue and bleach.

	Heterotrophy can however maintain the growth and metabolism of both symbionts and hosts whenever conditions are not favourable to autotrophy, such as in low-light environments (Anthony, 2000), or during seawater warming, which leads to oxidative stress, symbiont expulsion (bleaching) and nutritional starvation

	Plankton feeding significantly increased, in symbiont cells, the concentrations of three main micronutrients, namely Mn, Fe and Mg (Table 1). Among other functions, Mn, Fe and Mg are all involved in the composition of anti-oxidant enzymes (Krueger et al., 2015). These enzymes, such as catalases, peroxidases and Fe/Mn or Mn-superoxide dismutases (SOD), are present in Symbiodinium (Lin et al., 2015; Zhang, Zhuang, Gill, & Lin, 2013), and are used to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) continuously produced through photosynthesis and over-produced during thermal stress (Weis, 2008).

	This involvement of Fe and Mn in photosynthetic processes is one of the explanations why symbiont density, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rates are significantly enhanced in heterotrophically-fed coral colonies compared to unfed ones, both in normal growth and stress conditions

	For all corals, thermal stress also induced a very large increase of the Mg, Sr, Ca and B concentrations compared to normal growth conditions, in particular in symbionts of unfed colonies.

	In fed corals, heterotrophy supplied enough metals to the host to sustain symbiont‚Äôs needs and no bleaching is observed. In unfed corals, symbiont repletion lead to a significant depletion of metals in host tissue (Fig. 3B to F), and a cost for the symbiotic association, which underwent bleaching and nutrient starvation.

	The significant bleaching in unfed colonies further suggests that, contrary to fed corals, metal concentrations in unfed host tissue were not sufficient to sustain high densities of symbionts.

	The results obtained first reveal that symbionts are the major sink for trace metals in the symbiotic association, and accumulate Mn, Mg and Fe from the heterotrophic feeding of the host. They also demonstrate that bleaching is exacerbated by the shortage of trace metals in coral tissue (especially Cu, Zn, B, Mg, Ca) and that heterotrophic feeding can supply these essential metals to corals. Such results thus highlight a new way by which heterotrophy contributes to coral resistance to bleaching, and have major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under threat of global change.
