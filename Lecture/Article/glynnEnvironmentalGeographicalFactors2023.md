title: Abstract
color:: 

Aim: The symbioses between corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates have been described as a flexible relationship whose dynamics could serve as a source of resilience for coral reef ecosystems. However, the factors that drive the establishment and maintenance of this co-­evolutionary relationship remain unclear. We examined the environmental and geographical factors structuring dinoflagellate communities in a wide-­ranging Indo-­Pacific coral to begin to address this gap.

	specimens that had recently bleached were characterized by roughly equal proportions of Cladocopium spp. and Durusdinium spp., while specimens that had not recently bleached had a similar proportion of Durusdinium spp. as those that had recently bleached, but also showed a reduction in Cladocopium spp., with this deficiency made up by the presence of Symbiodinium spp.
