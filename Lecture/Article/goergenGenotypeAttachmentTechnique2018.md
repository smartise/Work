title: Abstract
color:: 

The Caribbean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, was once a dominant habitat creating coral, but its populations have declined dramatically in recent decades. Numerous restoration efforts now utilize coral gardening techniques to cultivate this species, growing colonies on fixed structures or from line/suspended nurseries. Line nurseries have become increasingly popular because of their small footprint and ease of use, replacing fixed structures in many nurseries. To evaluate the efficacy of the line technique, this study evaluated growth, condition, and survivorship of A. cervicornis nursery colonies of three distinct genotypes grown via two line nursery techniques (suspended and direct line attachment [vertical]). Direct line attachment of nursery colonies resulted in poor survival (43%) and growth (9.5 ¬± 1.33 cm/year), whereas suspended culture had 100% survival and increased growth (61.1 ¬± 4.19 cm/year). Suspended culture had significantly reduced disease prevalence and prevented colony predation. Suspended coral growth was also comparable to a neighboring fixed structure nursery (55.2 ¬± 7.86 cm/year), and found to be as effective in propagating corals as fixed structures.

	Implications for Practice ‚Ä¢ Fixed structure nursery culture may be a better option for low budget nurseries as corals can be left to grow unmaintained for longer periods without the worry of the structure failing or sinking. ‚Ä¢ Diversification of culture techniques and/or nursery locations should be implemented to increase success of underperforming genotypes. ‚Ä¢ Nurseries should not exclude genotypes with lower productivity or survivorship, as these characteristics are not necessarily temporally or geographically consistent. ‚Ä¢ Nursery design should consider projections of coral growth, required harvesting in order to minimize damaging contact between overgrown colonies, and potential failures of overweighted nursery structures.

	Acropora cervicornis‚Äô life history characteristics (fast-growing, branching morphology, and a prominent asexual reproductive strategy) lends the species well to nursery culture (Tunnicliffe 1981; Highsmith 1982), and makes cultivating colonies via artificial propagation an attractive means of supporting restoration efforts.

	With recent increased adoption of line nursery cultivation, due to ease of deployment, small footprint, and an increase in corals per unit, it is important to assess line performance against the original fixed structure technique (cinder or cement blocks) used in the Florida A. cervicornis nurseries (Johnson et al. 2011).

	Conditions such as bleaching, disease, predation, and overgrowth were recorded as an estimated percent of the colony affected. Total linear extension (TLE) was recorded for each colony (including branches greater than or equal to 5 mm; Fig. S1, Supporting Information) to the nearest millimeter using calipers (Larson 2010). Colonies were considered attached once tissue grew over attached wire or line.

	Choosing to solely use line nurseries based on the assumption that all suspended colonies have faster growth rates without evaluating the advantages of fixed structures may in fact reduce nursery efficiency. In addition, Kuffner et al. (2017) found that corals grown on floating structures had less dense skeletons than those on fixed structures, which could be problematic when outplanting back to the reef (increased colony breakage).
