title: Abstract
color:: 

Satisfying nutrient requirement of corals is still a major constraint for maintaining corals in marine aquariums. Corals are polytrophic in nature. Heterotrophic feeding on zooplankton is one of the corals’ strategies to overcome nutrient deﬁciency. Artemia salina nauplii are commonly used as biocarriers for many ﬁsh larvae in aquaculture and can also serve as a biocarrier for coral in aquariums, provided coral acceptability, optimal feeding rate, and digestibility of the nauplii are well understood. Feeding rate and digestibility of coral fed on A. salina nauplii at 100, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 10,000 ind. l-1 under light and dark conditions was assessed in this study. The maximum feeding rates of Galaxea fascicularis under light and dark conditions was 113.6 ind. polyp-1 h-1 and 76.9 ind. polyp-1 h-1, respectively. The daily feeding rates of G. fascicularis varies and depends on nauplii density. Light plays an important role in coral feeding. Nevertheless, the quantity of A. salina nauplii consumed by the coral under light and dark conditions was not signiﬁcantly different (P [ 0.05). A. salina nauplii are well accepted by G. fascicularis. Complete nauplii digestion was observed after 180 min. Digestibility of A. salina nauplii by G. fascicularis was positively correlated with digestion time.
