Khanh Hoa Coastal area is considered the area with the most diverse coral reefs in the west of the East Sea. With the trend of increasing global temperature, the coral reefs here are affected, including the phenomenon of bleaching. This paper uses a Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (MUR SST) data source to evaluate the possible relationship between sea surface temperature and coral bleaching in the period 2010-2019 in Khanh Hoa coastal area is based on two parameters: Hot Spot (HS) and Degree Heating Months (DHM). Research results show that in the past 10 years, corals in Khanh Hoa coastal area may experience heat stress in 6 years, including 2010, 2013 and the years from 2016 to 2019. The phenomenon of heat stress starts to occur in May of each year, and the level of heat stress in 2010 was stronger than in other years. Within 6 years, there have been heat stress, coral bleaching events due to temperature only occurred in 2010; while in 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, corals suffered from heat stress in the watch level, meaning an increase in temperature is not yet capable of causing coral bleaching. The cause of coral bleaching in 2010 was the combined effect of the increase in sea surface temperature and the suppression of upwelling during the southwest monsoon.
