PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) was used in industry for 37 years before it was found that PCB could accumulate in nature. At the time for the discovery (1966) PCB was almost as widespread as DDT. When organisms from Sweden were analysed, up to fourteen unknown peaks were found in the chromatograms. When a white-tailed eagle found dead in the archipelago of Stockholm was subjected to analysis these peaks could finally be identified as PCB with gas chromatography-masspectrometry. Recently, blood samples from PCB-intoxicated Japanese and other persons were analysed; blood levels of PCB and other contaminants were determined.
