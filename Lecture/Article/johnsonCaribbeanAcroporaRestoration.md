	Although they make up only a small percentage (‚Äπ1%) of the marine environment (Veron et al. 2009), coral reefs are home to one-third of all known marine species (Reaka-Kudla 1997, 2001).

	The coastlines of 100 countries are protected by coral reefs (Moberg and Folke 1999), shielding them from coastal erosion and protecting mangrove and lagoon habitats that support many life stages of important marine species (Johnson and Marshall 2007). These fragile ecosystems also support fishery resources that provide an important food source for humans. In addition to these physical resources provided by coral reefs, their intrinsic beauty draws and supports billions of dollars in tourism each year.

	The coral genus Acropora is a major reef-building taxon found in Florida and throughout the Greater Caribbean (Jackson 1992). As recently as the 1980s, these fast-growing corals formed dense, three-dimensional thickets in intermediate (5‚Äì20 m) water depths, contributing significantly to reef growth, island formation, coastal protection and fisheries habitat (Shinn 1966; Bruckner 2002). The open structural framework of these densely populated Acropora thickets provides essential habitat for fishes, turtles, lobsters, crabs, echinoids and gastropods (Bruckner 2002).

	A significant global decline in living coral coverage has occurred in recent decades in response to many anthropogenic and environmental disturbances such as coastal development, sedimentation, invasive species, storms, high sea temperatures, disease, pollution, overfishing and eutrophication (Hughes et al. 2003; Grimsditch and Salm 2006). Experts predict that one-third of all reef-building corals are at risk of extinction (Carpenter et al. 2008); fully 75% of reefs are highly threatened by the compounding effects of local stressors and factors associated with global climate change (e.g., ocean acidification, sea level rise, thermal stress, disease, cyclones) (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999; Buddemeier et al. 2004; Baker et al. 2008; Veron et al. 2009; Burke et al. 2011).

	A large portion of the recorded decline in coral abundance in the Caribbean region is actually due to the dramatic loss of Acropora. Acroporid coral populations have declined 80‚Äì90% throughout the Caribbean and western Atlantic since the late 1980s (Bruckner 2002), and both A. cervicornis (staghorn coral) and A. palmata (elkhorn coral) were listed as threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in May 2006. In 2008, both species were listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.

	The most severe threats to Acropora corals are diseases, predation, temperature-induced bleaching and physical damage from tropical storms. In addition to these main threats, eutrophication, sedimentation, anchor damage and vessel groundings also cause significant impacts locally.

	They are fast-growing, branching species that tend to be particularity vulnerable to threats such as temperature extremes, storms and disease.

	Nurseries should be deployed in areas with minimal human activities to minimize coral and platform damage.

	The ease of access to a nursery site is a key consideration, especially when frequent or particularly time-intensive maintenance is required. Deploying shallow nurseries close to home base minimizes fuel, boat and diving costs.

	Having multiple nurseries in different environments will minimize the likelihood that a given disturbance, such as a disease outbreak or storm, will destroy the entire nursery stock

	Line nurseries may provide the best method for rapid growth and branching of small fragments. Most line nursery efforts have shown significantly increased growth in fragments suspended off the bottom, with branching occurring in all directions and with greater frequency.

	However, it also appears that faster growth may result in changes to the density of the coral skeleton, resulting in fragments that are more fragile and prone to breakage. As a result, corals grown using the line methods will likely still need to be secured to a puck before outplanting to increase skeletal density and facilitate stabilization.

	To allow for donor (possible genetic) tracking, each fragment should be given a unique identifier that will allow it to be tracked back to its parent colony once at the nursery. This will allow for accurate tracking during subsequent creation of second- and third-generation fragments, as well as during outplanting efforts, to ensure potential genetic diversity at a given restoration site.

	In addition, colony condition (coloration, presence of disease, lesions, damselfish lawns) and abundance of predators (snails, fireworms) should be noted. This information can be used to evaluate the impacts of fragment collections and the stability of wild Acropora colonies over time.

	fragments from the donor colony branch tips as small as 3 cm in length will provide viable tissue for successful propagation of nursery colonies; however, fragments with multiple branches or that include more of the thicker base branch material show more rapid growth and branching when introduced to a nursery setting.

	Coral Attachment: Corals can be attached directly to the reef or using attachment platforms like masonry nails or cement pucks. Outplanted corals can be wedged into holes or crevices or secured using epoxy, cement, wire or plastic ties (for examples see Figures 1 and 2 from Case Study 1).

	Monitoring and Maintenance: Ideally, all outplants should be monitored after the first month and quarterly thereafter for 18 months. The monitoring should include a visual census of survivorship, with notes on condition, including bleaching, disease, predation and breakage. Suggested maintenance includes the removal of snails and fireworms from outplants and reattaching broken fragments at the outplant sites. The level of maintenance will depend on environmental factors, funding and goals of each project.
