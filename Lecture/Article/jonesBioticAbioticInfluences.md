	The evolution of efficient recycling between the heterotrophic host and the phototrophic symbiont (Muscatine & Porter 1977) permits tropical scleractinian corals to construct massive limestone skeletal structures in nutrient-depleted waters.

	The clades (and subclades) are predominantly differentiated based on their ribosomal gene sequences (Rowan & Powers 1991; LaJeunesse 2001, 2002; Baker 2003) and, more recently, with microsatellite and other high resolution analyses (e.g., Thornhill et al. 2009, 2013; Pettay et al. 2011).

	For instance, symbiont types differ in their response to light and temperature (Iglesias-Prieto & Trench 1994, 1997; Warner et al. 1999; Goulet et al. 2005; Loram et al. 2007a) suggesting that they may be suited to contrasting environmental conditions.

	Certain symbiont types are also regarded as thermally tolerant, particularly members of clade D (Glynn et al. 2001; Rowan 2004; Tchernov et al. 2004; Berkelmans & van Oppen 2006), conferring their hosts with increased resistance to temperature related bleaching.

	Bleaching susceptibility varies greatly depending on environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and light intensity), coral species (as well as subspecies, morphotype, or genet), and Symbiodinium identity.

	Symbiodinium is a genetically diverse genus which is currently divided into 9 distinct clades (categorized as A-I, Pochon & Gates 2010) with each clade containing multiple subcladal types (Stat et al. 2006).

	Certain symbiont types may confer greater stress tolerance (Rowan 2004; Berkelmans & van Oppen 2006; Jones et al. 2008; Fitt et al. 2009) while other types may provide more benefits to their host under non-stressful conditions (Little et al. 2004; Loram et al. 2007a).

	Coral symbiont identification All cores were biopsied at four time points during the experimental period: (1) at the start of the experiment (0 days of exposure); (2) six days after the ramping completion (2 weeks of exposure); (3) at the end of the exposure period (7 weeks of exposure); and (4) at the end of the experiment (5 weeks of shaded recovery). The DNA from each of the samples was extracted using a modified organic extraction protocol (Baker et al. 1997) which involved: incubating in 1% SDS at 65oC, digestion with Proteinase K at 55oC, incubation with 1% CTAB at 65oC, mixing with equal volume of chloroform at room temperature, 100% ethanol precipitation at -20oC, re-suspension of dried pellet in 0.3M sodium acetate and subsequent ethanol precipitation at -20oC, washing pellet in 70% ethanol, re-suspension of dried down DNA pellet in Tris-EDTA buffer, and storage at -20oC.

	DNA from the Symbiodinium internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS2) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was PCR-amplified using primers ITSintfor2 and ITS2clamp (LaJeunesse and Trench 2000) targeting the conserved flanking regions in the 5.8S subunit and 28S-like large subunit. The reverse primer incorporated a 40 base pair GC

A touch-down amplification protocol was used with an initial annealing temperature 10oC above the final annealing temperature of 52oC.

	The annealing temperature was decreased by 1oC every two cycles until 52oC was reached, where it remained for a further 15 cycles. PCR was performed using a DYAD thermocycler (MJ Research). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the ITS2 amplicons was used to identify the dominant Symbiodinium for each coral microcolony during the experiment. PCR products were run on 35-75% denaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels (100% denaturant consisted of 40% deionized formamide and 7M urea) using a CBS Scientific System (Del Mar, CA, USA) for approximately 16 hours at 90 volts. Bands of interest were excised and left in 100ÔÄ†ÔÅ≠L of molecular grade H2O (Rockland, PA, USA) overnight at 4oC. One ÔÅ≠L of the resulting DNA solution was then used as the DNA template in a PCR amplification using the same primers (with GC-clamp removed from reverse primer) and reaction mix as above. The thermocycling profile consisted of 3 minutes at 94oC followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94oC, 1 min at 60oC and 1 min at 72oC, and a final extension of 5 minutes at 72oC. Amplifications were checked on a 1.5% agarose gel to ensure they produced bright, single bands. Once checked, PCR products were treated with a mixture of Exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase to deactivate the polymerase and digest the primers (37oC for 30 minutes and 80oC for 15 minutes). Forward and reverse strands were then amplified using BigDye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) terminator chemistry. The 10ÔÄ†ÔÅ≠L reactions were amplified using 35 cycles of 96oC for 15s, 50oC for 15s and 60oC for 4 minutes.

Sequence chromatograms were manually inspected and assembled using Geneious (Biomatters Ltd.). Each sequence type was compared with named sequences in the Genbank database using the BLAST search tool.

	Symbiont community characterization An actin-based quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assay was used to monitor change in symbiont community structure (identity and abundance) in O. faveolata during the course of the experiment. Samples were assayed in duplicate using TaqMan-MGB (Life Technolgies) qPCR assays targeting specific actin loci in O. faveolata and Symbiodinium in clades B, C, and D (Cunning & Baker 2013; Cunning 2013). The O. faveolata assay included 150 nM OfavActF (5‚Äô- CGCTGACAGAATGCAGAAAGAA-3‚Äô), 100 nM OfavActR (5‚Äô- CACATCTGTTGGAAGGTGGACA-3‚Äô), and 250 nM OfavActProbe (5‚ÄôNED-TGAAGATCAAGATCATTGC-MGB-3‚Äô). The clade B assay included 200 nM BActF (5‚Äô- CGATGGCTTTGCAGCTCAA-3‚Äô), 300 nM BActR (5‚ÄôTGTCCCGGAATTTGTGCAA-3‚Äô), and 100 nM BActProbe (5‚Äô-FAMCTGTAAACCCTGTCATTC-MGB-3‚Äô). The clade C and D assays were multiplexed, using the same primers and reaction conditions as described in Cunning & Baker (2013). All reactions were carried out in 10 ŒºL volumes (with 5 ŒºL Taqman Genotyping MasterMix and 1 ŒºL DNA template) on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial incubation at 50¬∞C for 2 min and 95¬∞C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95¬∞C for 10

	19 and 60¬∞C for 1 min. Cycle threshold (CT) values were calculated by the StepOnePlus software package with a set fluorescence threshold of ‚àÜRn=0.01. Target DNA was considered present when amplification occurred in both technical replicates with no target detected in negative control reactions. CT values for O. faveolata and Symbiodinium clade B were reduced by 5.01 and 4.03 cycles, respectively, to normalize for differences in fluorescent signal intensity among TaqMan-MGB fluorophores. Cycle reductions were calculated based on the results of standard curves generated following the methods of Cunning and Baker (2013). Adjusted CT values were then used to calculate symbiont to host cell ratios using the formula . Clade C symbionts were not detected in these samples and thus were not involved in subsequent analyses.
