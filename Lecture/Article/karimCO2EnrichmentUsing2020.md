title: Abstract
color:: 

Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in greenhouses is sub-optimal for vegetable production. Many techniques have been used to increase CO2 concentration in greenhouses but most of them are expensive with certain limitations and drawbacks. We adopted a new strategy to elevate CO2 concentration in the greenhouse throughout the day via crop residues and animal manure composting (CRAM). During the whole cultivation period, CRAM-treated greenhouse had doubled CO2 concentration which signiﬁcantly increased the yield of cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), i.e., up to 38%. The inﬂuence of CRAM procedure on cherry tomato quality was also investigated and the concentrations of total soluble solids (TSS) and soluble sugar were found to be signiﬁcantly higher in cherry tomatoes grown under composting greenhouse than that of non-composting greenhouse. Additionally, CRAM-CO2 enrichment also resulted in increased concentrations of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and titrate acid as compared to control. In contrast, the concentration of nitrate was considerably decreased in cherry tomato grown under CO2 enriched condition than that of control. The increase in active oxygen metabolisms such as POD, CAT and SOD while a decrease in MDA, as well as APX was observed for cherry tomatoes grown under CO2 enriched condition. Hence, CO2 fertilization by using CRAM in greenhouse signiﬁcantly improved quality and increased the yield of cherry tomatoes.
