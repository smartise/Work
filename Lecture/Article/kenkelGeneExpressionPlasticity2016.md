	A year-long reciprocal transplant of mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) between a highly environmentally variable inshore habitat and a more stable offshore habitat demonstrated that populations exhibit phenotypic signatures that are consistent with local adaptation.

	. Furthermore, elevated plasticity of the environmental stress response expression was correlated with lower susceptibility to a natural summer bleaching event, suggesting that plasticity is adaptive in the inshore environment.

	Our results reveal a novel genomic mechanism of resilience to a variable environment, demonstrating that corals are capable of a more diverse molecular response to stress than previously thought.

	Gene expression is the proximate mechanism that links genotype to phenotype4 and plays a central role in cellular adaptation to environmental change5.

	Inshore corals from these same populations also exhibit greater thermal tolerance than corals from the offshore reef12,13. Here we employ genome-wide gene-expression profiling using TagSeq14,15 in conjunction with gene coexpression network analysis16 to explore the relationship between gene expression patterns of the host and symbiont and phenotypic trait variation in the same corals used in the reciprocal transplant experiment11.

	To investigate these differences in more detail and to explore their relationship with other quantitative traits, we conducted weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA16) on the host and symbiont datasets.

	Overall, these observations confirm that offshore corals are less capable of gene expression plasticity.

	Taken together, these results demonstrate that corals transplanted to inshore reefs upregulated cellular stress response genes, including molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins, whereas inshore-origin corals also downregulated ribosome biogenesis, a hallmark of the ESR5

	This indicates that differential thermal tolerance was due to the varying capacity for gene expression plasticity rather than elevated pre-emptive expression (‚Äòfrontloading‚Äô) of stress-response genes21.

	Briefly, 15 genotypes (individual colonies) of P. astreoides from both an inshore and an offshore reef (n = 30 total) in the Lower Florida Keys, USA, were fragmented, and pieces of each genotype were outplanted at both native and foreign sites (Supplementary Fig. 1) under Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary permit no. 2011‚Äì115

	Following one year of transplantation, coral growth rates, energetic stores (total protein, lipid and carbohydrate content), symbiont densities and chlorophyll content were measured for each genotype. Tissue samples of 1 cm2 were immediately taken from each coral fragment on field collection and preserved in RNALater (Ambion, Life Technologies) on ice. Samples were stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C until processing. Total RNA was extracted using an RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Life Technologies), with minor modifications.

	One microgram of total RNA per sample was used for tag-based RNA-seq, or TagSeq14, with modifications for sequencing on the Illumina platform. TagSeq has recently been demonstrated to generate more accurate estimates of protein-coding transcript abundances than standard RNA-seq, at a fraction of the cost15.
