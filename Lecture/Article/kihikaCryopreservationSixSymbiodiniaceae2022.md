title: Abstract
color:: 

Symbiodiniaceae are a diverse group of dinoflagellates, the majority of which are free-living and/or associated with a variety of protists and other invertebrate hosts. Maintenance of isolated cultures is labour-intensive and expensive, and cryopreservation provides an excellent avenue for their long-term storage. We aimed to cryopreserve 15 cultured isolates from six Symbiodiniaceae genera using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the cryoprotectant agent (CPA). Under 15% DMSO, 10 isolates were successfully cryopreserved using either rapid freezing or controlled-rate freezing. Cultures that failed or had low survival, were subjected to (1) a reduction of CPA to 10%, or (2) increased salinity treatment before freezing. At 10% DMSO, three further isolates were successfully cryopreserved. At 15% DMSO there were high cell viabilities in Symbiodinium pilosum treated with 44 parts per thousand (ppt) and 54 ppt culture medium. An isolate of Fugacium sp. successfully cryopreserved after salinity treatments of 54 ppt and 64 ppt. Fatty acid (FA) analyses of S. pilosum after 54 ppt salinity treatment showed increased saturated FA levels, whereas Fugacium sp. had low poly-unsaturated FAs compared to normal salinity (34 ppt). Understanding the effects of salinity and roles of FAs in cryopreservation will help in developing protocols for these ecologically important taxa.
