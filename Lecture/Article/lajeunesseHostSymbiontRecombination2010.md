title: Abstract
color:: 

Mutualisms between reef-building corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates are particularly sensitive to environmental stress, yet the ecosystems they construct have endured major oscillations in global climate. During the winter of 2008, an extreme cold-water event occurred in the Gulf of California that bleached corals in the genus
              Pocillopora
              harbouring a thermally ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô symbiont, designated
              Symbiodinium C1b-c
              , while colonies possessing
              Symbiodinium D1
              were mostly unaffected. Certain bleached colonies recovered quickly while others suffered partial or complete mortality. In most colonies, no appreciable change was observed in the identity of the original symbiont, indicating that these partnerships are stable. During the initial phases of recovery, a third species of symbiont
              B1
              
                Aiptasia
              
              , genetically identical to that harboured by the invasive anemone,
              Aiptasia
              sp., grew opportunistically and was visible as light-yellow patches on the branch tips of several colonies. However, this symbiont did not persist and was displaced in all cases by
              C1b-c
              several months later. Colonies with
              D1
              were abundant at inshore habitats along the continental eastern Pacific, where seasonal turbidity is high relative to offshore islands. Environmental conditions of the central and southern coasts of Mexico were not sufficient to explain the exclusivity of
              D1 Pocillopora
              in these regions. It is possible that mass mortalities associated with major thermal disturbances during the 1997‚Äì1998 El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation eliminated
              C1b-c
              holobionts from these locations. The differential loss of
              Pocillopora
              holobionts in response to thermal stress suggests that natural selection on existing variation can cause rapid and significant shifts in the frequency of particular coral‚Äìalgal partnerships. However, coral populations may take decades to recover following episodes of severe selection, thereby raising considerable uncertainty about the long-term viability of these communities.

	Severe or prolonged exposure to abnormally high or low temperatures may cause physiological stress that disrupts the intracellular symbiosis between photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium (symbiont) and reef-building corals

	Reef corals are obligate symbioses constrained by the combined physiological limitations of both partners and as functional units may exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental stressors (Iglesias-Prieto & Trench 1997; Fitt et al. 2001).
