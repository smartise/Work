title: Abstract
color:: 

Background: The drastic decline in the abundance of Caribbean acroporid corals (Acropora cervicornis, A. palmata) has prompted the listing of this genus as threatened as well as the development of a regional propagation and restoration program. Using in situ underwater nurseries, we documented the influence of coral genotype and symbiont identity, colony size, and propagation method on the growth and branching patterns of staghorn corals in Florida and the Dominican Republic.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Individual tracking of. 1700 nursery-grown staghorn fragments and colonies from 37 distinct genotypes (identified using microsatellites) in Florida and the Dominican Republic revealed a significant positive relationship between size and growth, but a decreasing rate of productivity with increasing size. Pruning vigor (enhanced growth after fragmentation) was documented even in colonies that lost 95% of their coral tissue/skeleton, indicating that high productivity can be maintained within nurseries by sequentially fragmenting corals. A significant effect of coral genotype was documented for corals grown in a common-garden setting, with fast-growing genotypes growing up to an order of magnitude faster than slow-growing genotypes. Algal-symbiont identity established using qPCR techniques showed that clade A (likely Symbiodinium A3) was the dominant symbiont type for all coral genotypes, except for one coral genotype in the DR and two in Florida that were dominated by clade C, with A- and C-dominated genotypes having similar growth rates.
Conclusion/Significance: The threatened Caribbean staghorn coral is capable of extremely fast growth, with annual productivity rates exceeding 5 cm of new coral produced for every cm of existing coral. This species benefits from high fragment survivorship coupled by the pruning vigor experienced by the parent colonies after fragmentation. These lifehistory characteristics make A. cervicornis a successful candidate nursery species and provide optimism for the potential role that active propagation can play in the recovery of this keystone species.

	oral Growth and Productivity Total Linear extension (TLE, [13]) was estimated for each individual using a flexible ruler at the time of deployment and again after 12 months. Measurements included all branches and were calculated to the closest cm (Fig. S1).

	Change in TLE over time (growth) was estimated as the total amount of tissue/skeleton produced between measurement intervals.

	In addition to growth, annual productivity was estimated as the amount of coral produced relative to the tissue/ skeleton present at the start of the study (annual productivity = growth/TLE at start of study).

	This 1-year period was selected to have a uniform growth interval to compare among the different nursery programs that conducted fragmentation and transplantation at different times of the year or in different years, and to be able to track fragments from the time they were created as ‚Äò‚Äòfingerlings‚Äô‚Äô with a simple morphology of 12 branches, to the time when complex branching morphology developed, marking the transition from fragments to colonies [14,15].

	Previous work by Lirman et al. [16] showed that the removal of small fragments (3‚Äì5 cm) appears to stimulate the growth of donor branches on parent colonies (after a brief initial hiatus in growth as the skeletal lesions heal and new apical polyps develop).

	we demonstrate that not only is the growth of donor colonies enhanced by pruning but that colonies can lose up to 95% of their tissue and skeleton through fragmentation and still have enhanced growth and recovery.

	The fast regrowth of damaged colonies after severe fragmentation has also been shown on wild populations of Acropora palmata after significant hurricane damage [24]. These life-history characteristics make acroporid corals highly successful nursery species and provide optimism for the potential role that active propagation can play in the their recovery.
