title: Abstract
color:: 

Reef-building corals are increasingly threatened by global and regional stresses, which affect the stability of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae association. Among them, plastic pollution has been an ongoing and growing concern. Whereas several studies have highlighted the detrimental impact of microplastics (0.1 μm–5 mm) on corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellate algae, the physiological changes induced by nanoplastic (NP, <0.1 μm) pollution are still poorly known. Long-term experiments (4 weeks) were conducted to investigate the effects of ecologically relevant NP concentrations (0 to 0.5 mg/L of 20 nm polystyrene NPs) on two Symbiodiniaceae in culture [CCMP2467 or Clade A1 and pd44b or Clade F1]. The effects of 0.5 mg/L NPs were also evaluated on Clade A1 living in symbiosis with the coral Stylophora pistillata, to assess the in hospite effects of NPs on coral symbionts. The photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II, the oxidative status of the Symbiodiniaceae and the coral host, as well as the host-symbiont stability were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Symbiodiniaceae in culture exhibited a significant decrease in the maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax) at NP concentrations as low as 0.005 mg/L, highlighting an impairment of the photosynthetic capacities of the dinoflagellates in presence of nanoplastics. Also, Clade A1 exhibited a significant decrease in its Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and an increase in Lipid Peroxidation (LPO), which evidence oxidative stress and cellular damage. Interestingly, Clade A1 in hospite did not show any signs of oxidative stress, however, the coral host exhibited increased TAC and LPO. Additionally, exposure of S. pistillata to 0.5 mg/L NPs induced significant bleaching (loss of symbionts and photosynthetic pigments). Overall, NPs were detrimental for both the Symbiodiniaceae in culture and the host-symbiont association. In the future, the persistence of reef corals may be severely impacted by the cumulative effects of nanoplastic pollution along with global warming.
