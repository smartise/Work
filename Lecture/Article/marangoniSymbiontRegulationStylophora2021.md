ABSTRACT
            Widespread coral bleaching and mortality, leading to coral reef decline, have been mainly associated with climate-change-driven increases in sea surface temperature. However, bleaching and mortality events have also been related to decreases in sea surface temperature, with cold stress events (e.g. La Ni√±a events) being expected to increase in frequency or intensity as a result of a changing climate. Cold stress creates physiological symptoms in symbiotic reef-building corals similar to those observed when they are heat stressed, and the biochemical mechanisms underpinning cold stress in corals have been suggested to be related to an oxidative stress condition. However, up to now, this hypothesis had not been tested. This study assessed how short and long cold excursions in seawater temperature affect the physiology and biochemical processes related to oxidative stress in the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata. We provide, for the first time, direct evidence that the mechanisms underpinning cold stress and bleaching are related to the production of reactive oxygen species, and that rapid expulsion of a significant proportion of the symbiont population by the host during cooling conditions is an acclimation mechanism to avoid oxidative stress and, ultimately, severe bleaching. Furthermore, this study is one of the first to show that upwelling conditions (short-term cold stress+nutrient enrichment) can provoke a more severe oxidative stress condition in corals than cold stress alone.

	The prevailing mechanism for bleaching under these conditions invokes an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the endosymbionts and/or the coral host. Excessive production of ROS causes major cellular damage, such as membrane oxidation, protein denaturation and damage to the genetic material (Suggett and Smith, 2020). Host and symbionts exhibited adaptations for neutralizing ROS and preventing cellular damage, which include an arsenal of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. Bleaching occurs when the antioxidant capacity of the holobiont becomes overwhelmed by the overproduction of ROS under stressful conditions (reviewed in Suggett and Smith, 2020).

	Such cold stress events are expected to increase in frequency owing to a changing climate (Kim et al., 2014; Glynn et al., 2018). Other local-scale physical processes such as upwellings, cold currents, wind-driven mixing and even tropical cyclones can reduce SST by several degrees in a few hours (Carrigan and Puotinen, 2014; Glynn and Stewart, 1973; Riegl et al., 2019; Green et al., 2019).

	This later study put forward several hypotheses for the lack of bleaching occurrence, such as reduced production of ROS (McGinty et al., 2012), more effective antioxidant capacity of Durusdinium symbionts to detoxify ROS (Krueger et al., 2014), or a capacity, like some more parasitic symbionts, to repress host immune responses (Detournay et al., 2012).

	Therefore, this study measured the physiological ( photosynthesis and respiration rates, symbiont density, chlorophyll concentration, protein biomass and growth) and biochemical traits (ROS production, antioxidant capacity and lipid damage)ofthecoralStylophora pistillata experimentally exposed to short- and long-term cold stress.

	Sample preparation Coral nubbins (n=6 per treatment and measurement, from different colonies) were cut into small pieces (0.5 cm2) and homogenized by ultrasound (20 kHz, Vibra-Cell‚Ñ¢ 75185, Bioblock Scientific, France) using 300 Œºl of the specific homogenization buffer for each analysis (as described below). We employed 20 pulses (2 s each) in order to disrupt the coral host tissue and release the endosymbiotic cells without breaking them. The remaining skeleton was discarded; the homogenized holobiont solution was centrifuged (5 min, 2000 g, 4¬∞C) to separate the coral host tissue (supernatant) and symbiotic algae ( pellet). The coral host tissue phase was collected and put in a new Eppendorf tube. Samples were again submitted to ultrasound (70 kHz, 20 s) and centrifuged according to each analysis (see below). The remaining pellet containing endosymbiotic cells was washed by thoroughly vortexing three times with homogenizing buffer followed by centrifugation (5 min, 2000 g, 4¬∞C) in order to eliminate the remaining coral tissue in the pellet. Then, 60 Œºl of homogenizing buffer was added to the clean pellet for a final ultrasound homogenization (70 kHz, 20 s). Finally, the symbiont cell homogenate was also centrifuged according to each analysis. To ensure there was no contamination by symbiont cells in the coral host homogenate, we performed chorophyll analysis using an aliquot of the homogenate, as previously described by Marangoni et al. (2019). The total protein content in each sample was determined according to Bradford (1976) using the Comassie (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit (23200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.

	Reactive oxygen species The quantification of intracellular ROS was performed at the end of both experiments for all treatments. ROS were also measured over time in experiment 2 for the control and cold stress treatment (after 5, 24 and 48 h). Measurements were carried out using the fluorescence technique described by Aguiar et al. (2008), with some modifications (Marangoni et al., 2020). Each sample was homogenized in a buffer containing Tris-HCl 100 mmol l‚àí1 ( pH 7.7), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 2 mmol l‚àí1 and MgCl2 5 mmol l‚àí1, and then centrifuged (20,000 g, 20 min, 4¬∞C). The protein content was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.8 mg ml‚àí1 for the coral host and endosymbiont homogenates to obtain the best fluorescence curves over time. In a flat-bottom black microplate, 10 Œºl of sample was added to a medium containing HEPES 30 mmol l‚àí1, KCl 200 mmol l‚àí1 and MgCl2 1 mmol l‚àí1 (pH 7.2). Finally, 10 Œºl of the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA 16 Œºmol l‚àí1 (Invitrogen) was added. Fluorescence (excitation: 488 nm; emission: 525 nm) was measured (every 5 min up to 50 min) using a spectrofluorometer (Xenius, Monaco). Results were expressed as fluorescence units per minute (FU min‚àí1).

	Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) Determination of TAC of soluble low molecular weight antioxidants was measured at the end of both experiments for all treatments using the OxiSelectTM Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The antioxidant net absorbance values of the samples were compared with a known uric acid standard curve, with absorbance values being proportional to the sample‚Äôs total antioxidant capacity. Absorbance readings were performed in a 96-well flat-bottom transparent microplate using spectrofluorometry (Xenius, Monaco). Data were normalized to the total protein content in the sample in each well and expressed as Œºmol l‚àí1 copper reducing equivalents (CRE) mg‚àí1 protein.

	Lipid peroxidation The oxidative damage to lipids (lipid peroxidation, LPO) was determined at the end of both experiments for all treatments according to Oakes and van der Kraak (2003). Each sample was homogenized in KCl (1.15%) solution containing 35 Œºmol l‚àí1 butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and centrifuged for 10 min (10,000 g, 4¬∞C). Samples (20 Œºl) were added to a reaction mixture containing BHT solution (35 Œºmol l‚àí1), 20% acetic acid ( pH 3.5), TBA (0.8%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (8.1%) and ultrapure water, and then incubated in a water bath at 95¬∞C for 30 min. After cooling, n-butanol was added with thorough vortexing. Mixtures were centrifuged (300 rpm, 15¬∞C, 10 min) and the immiscible organic layer was collected and added to a 96-well flat-bottom black microplate. Fluorescence (excitation: 515 nm; emission: 553 nm) was measured using a spectro-fluorometer (Xenius, Monaco). Data were normalized to the total protein content in the samples in each well and expressed as nmol MDA mg‚àí1 protein.

	symbionts during cold stress decreases the amount of ROS in the holobiont, and therefore results in lower demands on the antioxidant systems of the host tissue. Such a trade-off may prevent corals from experiencing severe oxidative stress, which can ultimately be lethal, at a cost of receiving less energy from photosynthesis for the maintenance of the holobiont‚Äôs physiological needs. In addition to expelling excess symbionts in order to adjust their redox balance, corals may also increase their levels of photoprotective pigments such as carotene and xanthophylls (Roth et al., 2012) in order to resist cold stress for as long as 9 months, although with reduced metabolism compared with corals under control conditions

	Nutrient enrichment alone enhanced both host (increased protein) and symbiont (increased photosynthetic efficiency and respiration) metabolism, because nutrients are essential, and often limiting, for coral growth

	The results of the ‚Äòupwelling condition‚Äô point to a disruption of the symbiosis by the combined effect of cold stress and nutrient enrichment. In such conditions, even a balanced N:P ratio (or a nonlimiting phosphorus concentration) did not prevent corals from undergoing an oxidative imbalance with an overproduction of ROS in the symbionts, followed by increased TAC, in both the coral host and symbionts.

	Therefore, corals maintained under upwelling conditions experienced the highest loss in symbionts and chlorophyll content, as well as the highest decrease in photosynthetic capacity compared with the other conditions.

	Also, our findings indicate that corals under upwelling conditions (lower temperature+increased nutrient levels) can be more susceptible to oxidative stress and, ultimately, bleaching. Considering that upwelling regions are considered to be possible refugia for reefs in a time of changing climate, future studies under field conditions should be undertaken.
