title: Abstract
color:: 

Coral bleaching, loss of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae from the coral holobiont, is a complex phenomenon that can result in coral death and reef degradation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying this event. To determine if antioxidants can be used to reduce ROS production and coral bleaching, we tested the effects of thermal stress in Aiptasia pallida a model system for coral bleaching studies, and the scleractinian coral, Porites astreoides. We analyzed host ROS levels, symbiont dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II, and symbiont loss in the presence or absence of antioxidants. We found that a single dose of the antioxidant catechin, significantly reduced ROS levels in the hosts, mitigated the degradation of the symbiont‚Äôs quantum yield and reduced the loss of symbionts from thermally stressed P. astreoides but not from A. pallida. Taken together, these results support a key role of ROS and that antioxidants can prevent symbiont degradation and loss during thermally-induced bleaching in P. astreoides.

	Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been proposed as a major 56	 mechanism leading to loss or degradation of symbionts from their coral host cells during 57	 the late phases of coral bleaching

	ROS consist mainly 58	 of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion radical (O2.‚àí), and singlet state oxygen 59	 (1O2), which can cause damage to membranes, DNA, and protein denaturation of both 60	 symbiont and host cells leading to coral bleaching, and in some cases death (Lesser, 61	 2006). ROS scavenging in cells is accomplished mainly by superoxide dismutase and 62	 ascorbate peroxidase, but the increase in ROS associated with thermal stress can exceed 63	 detoxification rates, resulting in deterioration and degradation of the holobiont (Matta and 64	 Trench, 1991; Smith et al., 2005).

	Most importantly, we found that treatment with a naturally-occurring 289	 antioxidant can reduce ROS in coral tissues and possibly protect the symbiont loss.

	We also saw a loss of symbionts under control 306	 conditions when we exposed our organisms to catechin in the absence of a temperature 307	 increase, whereas exposure to both thermal stress and catechin had results similar to 308	 control conditions in both A. pallida and P. astreoides.

	itself could be damaging to photosynthetic pathways, perhaps by reducing ROS below a 310	 functional level required for signaling or other cellular processes, which in turn could 311	 trigger the loss of symbionts.

	Can antioxidants be utilized to prevent coral 325	 bleaching in their natural environment? Such an appealing idea will need careful 326	 consideration and further investigation in other coral and animal species before any field 327	 testing
