title: Abstract
color:: 

Microscopic Ô¨Ålaments of the siphonous green algae Ostreobium (Ulvophyceae, Bryopsidales) colonize and dissolve the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral colonies in reefs of contrasted salinities. Here, we analyzed their bacterial community‚Äôs composition and plasticity in response to salinity. Multiple cultures of Pocillopora coral-isolated Ostreobium strains from two distinct rbcL lineages representative of IndoPaciÔ¨Åc environmental phylotypes were pre-acclimatized (>9 months) to three ecologically relevant reef salinities: 32.9, 35.1, and 40.2 psu. Bacterial phylotypes were visualized for the Ô¨Årst time at Ô¨Ålament scale by CARD-FISH in algal tissue sections, within siphons, at their surface or in their mucilage. Ostreobium-associated microbiota, characterized by bacterial 16S rDNA metabarcoding of cultured thalli and their corresponding supernatants, were structured by host genotype (Ostreobium strain lineage), with dominant Kiloniellaceae or Rhodospirillaceae (Alphaproteobacteria, Rhodospirillales) depending on Ostreobium lineage, and shifted Rhizobiales‚Äô abundances in response to the salinity increase. A small core microbiota composed of seven ASVs (~1.5% of thalli ASVs, 19‚Äì36% cumulated proportions) was persistent across three salinities in both genotypes, with putative intracellular Amoebophilaceae and Rickettsiales_AB1, as well as Hyphomonadaceae and Rhodospirillaceae also detected within environmental (Ostreobium-colonized) Pocillopora coral skeletons. This novel knowledge on the taxonomic diversity of Ostreobium bacteria paves the way to functional interaction studies within the coral holobiont.

	Multiple Ostreobineae genotypes co-exist with diverse prokaryote communities with a patchy spatial structure at the centimeter scale [25], which are typically more well-characterized and more genetically diversified in massive slow-growing than branched fast-growing coral host colonies, both in reef [26] and aquarium settings [14].
