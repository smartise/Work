Background
              
                The architecturally important coral species
                Acropora cervicornis
                and
                A.Â palmata
                were historically common in the Caribbean, but have declined precipitously since the early 1980s. Substantial resources are currently being dedicated to coral gardening and the subsequent outplanting of asexually reproduced colonies of
                Acropora
                , activities that provide abundant biomass for both restoration efforts and for experimental studies to better understand the ecology of these critically endangered coral species.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                We characterized the bacterial and archaeal community composition of
                A. cervicornis
                corals in a Caribbean nursery to determine the heterogeneity of the microbiome within and among colonies. Samples were taken from three distinct locations (basal branch, intermediate branch, and branch tip) from colonies of three different coral genotypes.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Overall, microbial community composition was similar among colonies due to high relative abundances of the Rickettsiales genus MD3-55 (
                Candidatus
                Aquarickettsia) in nearly all samples. While microbial communities were not different among locations within the same colony, they were significantly different between coral genotypes. These findings suggest that sampling from any one location on a coral host is likely to provide a representative sample of the microbial community for the entire colony. Our results also suggest that subtle differences in microbiome composition may be influenced by the coral host, where different coral genotypes host slightly different microbiomes. Finally, this study provides baseline data for future studies seeking to understand the microbiome of nursery-reared
                A. cervicornis
                and its roles in coral health, adaptability, and resilience.

	. Ecologically, repopulation of Acropora corals is critical for improving the 51 health of entire reef systems because they contribute to reef accretion and provide structural 52 complexity that serves as important habitat for fish and other reef organisms.

	Fragmented corals rapidly grow in in situ ocean nurseries and are then outplanted 62 back to reefs, a method that has proven to be highly effective for producing abundant A. 63 cervicornis biomass.

	This improved growth and decreased mortality of A. cervicornis in ocean 64 nurseries in comparison corals attached to reefs is due in part to reduced predation by the 65 corallivorous snail Coralliophila abbreviata and the fireworm Hermodice carunculata [9]. In 66 addition to the direct effects of predation on colony health, C. abbreviata is a known vector for 67 white-band disease [13] and H. carunculata is a known vector for the coral pathogen Vibrio 68 shilohi [14].
