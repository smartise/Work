title: Abstract
color:: 

Pocillopora corals are the main reef builders in the eastern tropical PaciÔ¨Åc. The validity of Pocillopora morphospecies remains under debate because of disagreements between morphological and genetic data. To evaluate the temporal stability of morphospecies in situ, we monitored the shapes of individual colonies in three communities in the southern Gulf of California for 44 months. Twenty-three percent of tagged colonies of Pocillopora damicornis changed to Pocillopora inÔ¨Çata morphology during this time. This switch in identity coincided with a shift to a higher frequency of storms and lower water turbidity (i.e., lower chlorophyll a levels). Seven months after the switch, P. inÔ¨Çata colonies were recovering their original P. damicornis morphology. All colonies of both morphospecies shared a common mitochondrial identity, but most P. damicornis colonies undergoing change were at a site with low-Ô¨Çow conditions. This is the Ô¨Årst in situ study to document switching between described morphospecies, and it elucidates the inÔ¨Çuence of temporal shifts in environmental conditions on morphologically plastic responses.

	Scleractinian corals are traditionally described according to differences in their skeletal morphology (i.e., as morphospecies; Best et al. 1984; Veron 2013). However, corals can modify their morphology to cope with variation among habitats and environmental shifts over time (Prada et al. 2008; Pfennig et al. 2010).

	Pocillopora corals are the main reef builders in the eastern tropical Pacific, despite growing under environmental conditions that are generally unfavorable for reef development and that can become worse still during broad interannual changes

	Much of the confusion in Pocillopora taxonomy is due to species descriptions that rely on colony and branch traits known to be highly plastic in the environmentally variable eastern tropical Pacific.

	If so, then shifts in environmental conditions may trigger morphological changes between morphospecies. Although corals are known to change their morphology following transplantation to a new environment (Hoogenboom et al. 2008; Prada et al. 2008; Todd 2008), such morphological changes have not been documented under natural conditions.

	A similar switch between these morphologies may have previously gone unnoticed due to the small size of the swollen node growth (!1.5 cm of width) during the morphological transition (fig. 2B).

	Our findings show that some coral colonies can maintain their morphology over long periods (unchanged colonies over more than 3 years, fig. A1), whereas others at the same location show fast and remarkable morphological changes at the branch and colony level over short periods (8 months). If other such events of morphological plasticity occur along the Eastern Pacific, these may be responsible for the marked interannual fluctuations of abundance in these and other morphospecies that have been noted previously (Guzm√°n and Cort√©s 2001).

	Thus, we suggest that the P. inflata shape is a morphotype that develops in response to storm events occurring during the summer and autumn periods of 2 previous years.

	For example, P. inflata was reported in the Galapagos Islands for the first time during a period of coral recovery from disturbances produced by the 1982‚Äì1983 El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation event (Glynn 1999). The swollen branch response that we saw in changed colonies was not found in all morphotypes, nor was it found at all studied sites, but it was most frequent at the site with low-flow conditions.

	Similar morphological responses under enhanced flow have been reported elsewhere. For example, transplanted fragments of P. damicornis began to develop thicker, more swollen branches after 9 months of constant high (20 cm/s) flow (Nakamura and Yamasaki 2006). Pocillopora verrucosa also developed short but swollen branches after 2 years in higher flow (Mass et al. 2011). Models also predict that thicker, swollen branches will be induced by high water flow and light availability (Filatov et al.

	In contrast to experimental studies, where constant water flow is provided, our observations indicate that (1) the short, swollen branch response does not necessarily occur in all individuals under natural conditions and (2) similar changes in morphology may be triggered by pulses of high flow caused by storms.

	California show that Pocillopora morphospecies display an association with two Symbiodinium types (C1b-c and D1; Pettay et al. 2011; McGinley et al. 2012). Additional integrative studies should test whether changes to the hostsymbiont combination and their synergistic effects could be related to the morphological plasticity reported here. Pocillopora corals display a high number of morphospecies in the Tropical Eastern Pacific within only three mitochondrial lineages (Pinz√≥n and LaJeunesse 2012; PazGarc√≠a et al. 2015), especially in the Gulf of California, where five morphospecies cooccur and share a single mitochondrial lineage (type 1).

	we suggest that P. inflata shape is an artificial group triggered by stressful conditions and that at least some of the morphological diversity seen in Pocillopora in the Tropical Eastern Pacific is driven by shifts in environmental conditions.
