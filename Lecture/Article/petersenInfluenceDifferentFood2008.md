title: Abstract
color:: 

In coral aquaculture, sexual reproduction increasingly plays an important role for serving trade and reef restoration purposes. However, until coral juveniles reach a semi-stable size which makes them less vulnerable against algal growth and sedimentation, high mortality rates may occur in the first several weeks to months after settlement. In the present study, the influence of several food sources on the growth and survival of newly settled primary polyps was studied under laboratory conditions for 5¬†months. In order to estimate effects on specimens of both reproductive modes, experiments were carried out with the brooder, Favia fragum, and with the broadcast spawner, Acropora tenuis. Primary polyps kept in 2-liter aquaria were daily fed with freshly hatched Artemia salina, the micro algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum and a commercially available dry food (Nori Micro, Zoolife¬Æ), respectively, at various concentrations. Growth rates in both species were significantly higher in the Artemia treatment with maximum rates of 9.4¬±4.9¬†mm2 (mean¬±S.D.; d=5¬†months) for F. fragum and 26.8¬±10.3¬†mm2 (d=5¬†months) for A. tenuis compared to all other treatments and the control (no additional food). Survival in F. fragum was overall higher than 60% in all treatments with maximum rates of 85.0¬±12.6% at the highest Artemia concentration. Survival rates in A. tenuis ranged from 28.9¬±4.7% (lowest Nori concentration) to 86.2¬±5.9% (medium Artemia concentration). The present study shows that Artemia nauplii may greatly enhance the growth and partly enhance the survival of early sexual recruits which may significantly help to more rapidly overcome the early and most fragile post-settlement stages. As a consequence, the residence time for sexual coral recruits in cost- and labour-intensive hatcheries may be greatly reduced.
