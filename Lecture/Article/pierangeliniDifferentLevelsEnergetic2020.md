title: Abstract
color:: 

Disentangling the metabolic functioning of corals’ endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) is relevant to understanding the response of coral reefs to warming oceans. In this work, we ﬁrst question whether there is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium, Durusdinium and Effrenium), and second, how different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive responses to global warming.
