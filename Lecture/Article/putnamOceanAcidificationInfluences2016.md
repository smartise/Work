title: Abstract
color:: 

As climate change challenges organismal Ô¨Åtness by creating a phenotype‚Äìenvironment mismatch, phenotypic plasticity generated by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) can provide a temporal buffer for genetic adaptation. Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation (OA) and warming reÔ¨Çect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to Ô¨Çuctuating ambient pH (7.9‚Äì7.65) and low pH (7.6‚Äì7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for ~6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no difference in calciÔ¨Åcation, minimal separation of metabolomic proÔ¨Åles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calciÔ¨Åcation at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic proÔ¨Åles, and responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of DNA methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.
