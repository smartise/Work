title: Abstract
color:: 

As climate change challenges organismal Ô¨Åtness by creating a phenotype‚Äìenvironment mismatch, phenotypic plasticity generated by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) can provide a temporal buffer for genetic adaptation. Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation (OA) and warming reÔ¨Çect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to Ô¨Çuctuating ambient pH (7.9‚Äì7.65) and low pH (7.6‚Äì7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for ~6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no difference in calciÔ¨Åcation, minimal separation of metabolomic proÔ¨Åles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calciÔ¨Åcation at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic proÔ¨Åles, and responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of DNA methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.

	Phenotypic plasticity is the flexibility for a single genotype to produce a range of responses to biotic and abiotic environmental conditions (Hochachka and Somero 2002).

	Phenotypic plasticity, therefore, provides a real-time compensatory response to this rapid environmental change that can act to provide a temporal buffer during which genetic variation can respond under natural selection. Additionally, the interplay of genetic and epigenetic variation results in emergent evolutionary properties that can influence the capacity for organisms to respond to swift environmental change (Ghalambor et al. 2015).

	One mechanism of phenotypic plasticity that has the potential to facilitate rapid beneficial acclimatization (Huey et al. 1999; Wilson and Franklin 2002) and is gaining attention across taxa from humans (Egger et al. 2004) to plants (Rapp and Wendel 2005) is epigenetics, or the heritable postsynthesis modification of DNA or DNA-associated proteins, without a change in the DNA sequence itself (Feil and Fraga 2012). Epigenetic mechanisms provide capacity for the genome to produce multiple outcomes from the same genetic material, via changes in gene expression, induced by developmental differentiation (Waddington 1942) and environmental triggering (Bossdorf et al. 2008; Feil and Fraga 2012).

	chromatin modifications (Li 2002; Greer and Shi 2012), DNA methylation (Bird 2002), and small RNAs (Feil and Fraga 2012; Castel and Martienssen 2013). The best studied of these mechanisms to date, however, is epigenetic reprogramming via DNA methylation.

	DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group (‚ÄìCH3) to DNA nucleotides, most commonly on cytosine in the sequence CpG in animals. This chemical modification, well studied in vertebrates, results in alteration of access of transcriptional proteins to the promoter regions of DNA (Bird 2002; Suzuki and Bird 2008), thereby influencing transcriptional outcomes.

	Epigenetic control of gene expression is heritable by way of maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) that propagates hemimethylated DNA during cell replication (Bird 2002; Feil and Fraga 2012). Additionally, DNA methylation is environmentally inducible, occurring in real-time due to the activity of de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3) that initiates novel DNA methylation in response to environmental triggers (Okano et al. 1999; Feil and Fraga 2012).

	This environmentally responsive mechanism of phenotypic regulation provides one avenue of dynamic phenotypic plasticity that could lead to beneficial acclimatization to changing physical conditions, with the potential for heritability.

	DNA methylation patterning is diverse across taxa. Whereas DNA methylation in vertebrates commonly occurs more globally, resulting in silencing of gene expression, in invertebrates, the methylation patterns are more variable, primarily found on gene bodies and exons.

	The depletion of CpG nucleotides in the genome (observed CpG vs. expected; CpGO/E) provides a signature of consistent historical methylation, as methylated cytosines are hypersensitive to deamination to thymine; predicted methylation based on CpGO/E correlates strongly with empirical measurements (Suzuki et al. 2007; Gavery and Roberts 2013). The examination of predicted methylation in the coral Acropora millepora indicates a bimodal distribution of genes, where those with low CpGO/E (strong methylation) are correlated with low expression plasticity and those with high CpGO/E (weak methylation) are correlated with higher expression plasticity (Dixon et al. 2014).

	Importantly, patterns of DNA methylation in the soma have the potential to be inherited through the soma, as sequestration of the germ cells is thought to be lacking in cnidarians (Buss 1983; but see Barfield et al. 2016) and some corals can produce asexual offspring (Yeoh and Dai 2010; Combosch and Vollmer 2013), thereby providing a memory of recent environmental change.

	Early work in corals suggests that intragenerational beneficial acclimatization to environmental stressors occurs. For example, repeated bleaching of Goniastrea in Thailand resulted in acclimatization in the initially bleached portions of the corals, which did not display paling during the second event (Brown et al. 2002). Further, thermal history played a mitigating role in photophysiological performance of the coral symbionts preconditioned to increased temperature when they were subsequently re-exposed (Middlebrook et al. 2008). More recently, work examining the mechanisms underlying beneficial acclimation to fluctuating temperatures identified strong ubiquitous expression of a set of genes that provided thermal resilience via expression frontloading of genes involved in heat-shock response, antioxidants, and other regulatory roles

	Further, corals transplanted from a location of moderate thermal variability to that of high variability acquired the sensitivity of the transplantation destination, with gene expression profiles identifying a group of differentially expressed genes responsible for this acclimatization (Palumbi et al. 2014). These included genes involved, for example, in cell signaling, heat-shock response, and those acting as molecular chaperones.

	Additionally, parental preconditioning to OA and temperature results in positive transgenerational acclimation in the offspring (Putnam and Gates 2015). Together, these studies indicate that phenotypic plasticity, which may provide rapid beneficial acclimatization to climate change, is a key mechanism for corals that has yet to be fully considered in our predictions reef futures in a time of rapid environmental change.

	Specifically, there was no difference in host DNA methylation in M. capitata between treatments at week 6 and an approximate doubling of methylation in the high pCO2 treatment in comparison with the ambient for P. damicornis (Table 2, Fig. 3B). The % DNA methylation within the host fraction of M. capitata was ~2.4 times higher than in P. damicornis (F1,27 = 6.63, P = 0.016, Fig. 3) within the baseline ambient condition.

	Our results indicate inducible DNA methylation provides one such avenue for generating phenotypic plasticity, but that response is likely to vary by taxa and duration of exposure.

	Our work suggests a role for de novo DNA methylation as a driving mechanism for phenotypic plasticity that may underlie intra- and transgenerational acclimation, and the heritable nature of this DNA methylation has been clearly demonstrated in other taxa (Verhoeven et al. 2010; Mirouze and Paszkowski 2011; Schield et al. 2015).
