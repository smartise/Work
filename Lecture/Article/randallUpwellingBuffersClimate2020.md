title: Abstract
color:: 

Corals of the eastern tropical Pacific live in a marginal and oceanographically dynamic environment. Along the Pacific coast of Panam√°, stronger seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Panam√° in the east transitions to weaker upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ in the west, resulting in complex regional oceanographic conditions that drive differential coral-reef growth. Over millennial timescales, reefs in the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ recovered more quickly from climatic disturbances compared with reefs in the Gulf of Panam√°. In recent decades, corals in the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ have also had higher growth rates than in the Gulf of Panam√°. As the ocean continues to warm, however, conditions could shift to favor the growth of corals in the Gulf of Panam√°, where upwelling may confer protection from high-temperature anomalies. Here we describe the recent spatial and temporal variability in surface oceanography of nearshore environments in Pacific Panam√° and compare those conditions with the dynamics of contemporary coral-reef communities during and after the 2016 coral-bleaching event. Although both gulfs have warmed significantly over the last 150 yr, the annual thermal maximum in the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ is increasing faster, and ocean temperatures there are becoming more variable than in the recent past. In contrast to historical trends, we found that coral cover, coral survival, and coral growth rates were all significantly higher in the Gulf of Panam√°. Corals bleached extensively in the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ following the 2015‚Äì2016 El Ni√±o event, whereas upwelling in the Gulf of Panam√° moderated the high temperatures caused by El Ni√±o, allowing the corals largely to escape thermal stress. As the climate continues to warm, upwelling zones may offer a temporary and localized refuge from the thermal impacts of climate change, while reef growth in the rest of the eastern tropical Pacific continues to decline.

	The eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) is an oceanographically dynamic environment that is home to some of the most isolated coral reefs in the world (Dana 1975, Fiedler 1992, Cort es 1997, Glynn and Ault 2000). Reef communities of the ETP live in marginal environments defined by extremes of temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations (Fiedler 1992, 2002).

	There is a strong oceanographic gradient from the Gulf of Panam a in the east, where there is seasonally strong, wind-driven, upwelling, to the Gulf of Chiriquƒ±   in the west where upwelling is weaker because of orographic blocking (Cort es 1997, Poveda et al. 2006, Glynn et al. 2017b ).

	Panam a‚Äôs two Pacific gulfs are also subject to interannual variability driven by the El Ni~ noSouthern Oscillation (ENSO; Fiedler 2002, Wang and Fiedler 2006, Alexander et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2017).

	For millennia, conditions in the Gulf of Chiriqu ƒ±have been warmer and more stable than in the Gulf of Panam a, favoring more rapid coral growth and more extensive reef accretion (Glynn 1976, 1977, Glynn and Macintyre 1977, Toth et al. 2012, 2015b ).

	By contrast, the thermal regime in the Gulf of Panama  has been influenced by strong seasonal upwelling events, leading to cooler and more variable conditions that have resulted in slower-growing corals and less long-term reef accretion (Glynn 1977, Glynn and Macintyre 1977, Toth et al. 2012, 2015b ).

	In the Gulf of Panam a, seasonal upwelling is driven by the annual migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between 10 and 3¬∞ N (Poveda et al. 2006).

	During the boreal winter (the dry season from December to mid-April), the ITCZ migrates south of the Isthmus of Panam a, intensifying the northeast trade winds across the region (D‚ÄôCroz and O‚ÄôDea 2007, Alexander et al. 2012).

	These winds force surface waters offshore and bring cold, nutrient-rich, deep water up and onto the shelf (Fiedler 1992, D‚ÄôCroz and O‚ÄôDea 2007). Such wind-driven upwelling events can reduce sea-surface temperature (SST) in the Gulf of Panam aby10¬∞C within a few days to weeks (Glynn and Stewart 1973, Glynn 1977).

	The topographic differential along the Isthmus of Panam a, with the high Central American cordillera mountain range (the Cordillera Central) to the west and a topographic low in the Cordillera Central to the east, produces a pronounced gradient in upwelling strength along Panam a‚Äôs Pacific coast: orographic effects in the west inhibit trade winds, markedly reducing upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriquƒ±   compared with the Gulf of Panam a (D‚ÄôCroz and O‚ÄôDea 2007, Toth et al. 2015a).
