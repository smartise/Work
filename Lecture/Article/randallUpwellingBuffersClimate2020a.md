title: Abstract
color:: 

Corals of the eastern tropical Pacific live in a marginal and oceanographically dynamic environment. Along the Pacific coast of Panamá, stronger seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Panamá in the east transitions to weaker upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriquí in the west, resulting in complex regional oceanographic conditions that drive differential coral-reef growth. Over millennial timescales, reefs in the Gulf of Chiriquí recovered more quickly from climatic disturbances compared with reefs in the Gulf of Panamá. In recent decades, corals in the Gulf of Chiriquí have also had higher growth rates than in the Gulf of Panamá. As the ocean continues to warm, however, conditions could shift to favor the growth of corals in the Gulf of Panamá, where upwelling may confer protection from high-temperature anomalies. Here we describe the recent spatial and temporal variability in surface oceanography of nearshore environments in Pacific Panamá and compare those conditions with the dynamics of contemporary coral-reef communities during and after the 2016 coral-bleaching event. Although both gulfs have warmed significantly over the last 150 yr, the annual thermal maximum in the Gulf of Chiriquí is increasing faster, and ocean temperatures there are becoming more variable than in the recent past. In contrast to historical trends, we found that coral cover, coral survival, and coral growth rates were all significantly higher in the Gulf of Panamá. Corals bleached extensively in the Gulf of Chiriquí following the 2015–2016 El Niño event, whereas upwelling in the Gulf of Panamá moderated the high temperatures caused by El Niño, allowing the corals largely to escape thermal stress. As the climate continues to warm, upwelling zones may offer a temporary and localized refuge from the thermal impacts of climate change, while reef growth in the rest of the eastern tropical Pacific continues to decline.

	Panam a’s two Pacific gulfs are also subject to interannual variability driven by the El Ni~ noSouthern Oscillation (ENSO; Fiedler 2002, Wang and Fiedler 2006, Alexander et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2017).

	For millennia, conditions in the Gulf of Chiriqu ıhave been warmer and more stable than in the Gulf of Panam a, favoring more rapid coral growth and more extensive reef accretion (Glynn 1976, 1977, Glynn and Macintyre 1977, Toth et al. 2012, 2015b ). By contrast, the thermal regime in the Gulf of Panama  has been influenced by strong seasonal upwelling events, leading to cooler and more variable conditions that have resulted in slower-growing corals and less long-term reef accretion (Glynn 1977, Glynn and Macintyre 1977, Toth et al. 2012, 2015b ).

	In the Gulf of Panam a, seasonal upwelling is driven by the annual migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between 10 and 3° N (Poveda et al. 2006).

	During the boreal winter (the dry season from December to mid-April), the ITCZ migrates south of the Isthmus of Panam a, intensifying the northeast trade winds across the region (D’Croz and O’Dea 2007, Alexander et al. 2012). These winds force surface waters offshore and bring cold, nutrient-rich, deep water up and onto the shelf (Fiedler 1992, D’Croz and O’Dea 2007). Such wind-driven upwelling events can reduce sea-surface temperature (SST) in the Gulf of Panam aby10°C within a few days to weeks

	Glynn and Macintyre (1977) found that there was more longterm reef accretion in the Gulf of Chiriquı   compared with the Gulf of Panam a. Previous studies also suggested that coral colonies in the Gulf of Chiriquı   historically had significantly higher growth rates compared with the Gulf Panam a (3.9 cm/yr compared with 3.1 cm/yr, respectively; Glynn 1977). These differences were attributed to the negative influence of intense upwelling in the Gulf of Panam a (Glynn 1977, Glynn and Macintyre 1977)
