title: Abstract

Rehman, A. U., Szabó, M., Deák, Z., Sass, L., Larkum, A., Ralph, P., & Vass, I. (2016). _Symbiodinium_ sp. Cells produce light‐induced intra‐ and extracellular singlet oxygen, which mediates photodamage of the photosynthetic apparatus and has the potential to interact with the animal host in coral symbiosis. _New Phytologist_, _212_(2), 472–484.
