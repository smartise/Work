title: Abstract
color:: 

As one of the most prolific and widespread reef builders, the staghorn coral Acropora holds a disproportionately large role in how coral reefs will respond to accelerating anthropogenic change. We show that although Acropora has a diverse history extended over the past 50 million years, it was not a dominant reef builder until the onset of high-amplitude glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations 1.8 million years ago. High growth rates and propagation by fragmentation have favored staghorn corals since this time. In contrast, staghorn corals are among the most vulnerable corals to anthropogenic stressors, with marked global loss of abundance worldwide. The continued decline in staghorn coral abundance and the mounting challenges from both local stress and climate change will limit the coral reefs‚Äô ability to provide ecosystem services.

	Over the past decades, worldwide deterioration of coral reefs is widely recognized (8, 9). They are increasingly affected by ocean warming and acidification, two severe disturbances associated with climate change.

	Although we have demonstrated that staghorn coral has been a winner under rapid sealevel changes for the past 2 My, staghorn corals are highly sensitive to both biotic and abiotic stressors.

	The susceptibility of staghorn coral to predator outbreaks, bleaching, disease, ocean acidification, and water quality is well documented (49‚Äì52).

	Anthropogenic stressors are expected to intensify in the coming decades, and failure to alter this trajectory could result in the ecological extinction of Acropora with a consequent decline in ecological functioning of reef systems (46).
