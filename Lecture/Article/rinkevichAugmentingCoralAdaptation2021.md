title: Abstract
color:: 

Unceasing climate change and anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs worldwide lead the needs for augmenting adaptive potential of corals. Currently, the most successful approach for restoring degraded reefs is ‘coral gardening’, where corals are farmed in underwater nurseries, then outplanted to damaged reefs. Dealing with enhanced coral adaptation, the ‘coral gardening’ approach is conceptually structured here within a hierarchical list of five encircling tiers that include all restoration activities, focusing on the nursery phase. Each tier en­ compasses all the activities performed in the levels below it hierarchically. The first is the ‘coral mariculture’ tier, followed by the ‘ecological engineering’ tier. The third is the adaptation-based reef restoration (ABRR) tier, preceding the fourth (‘ecosystem seascape’) and the fifth (‘ecosystem services’) tiers. The ABRR tier is further conceptualized and its constituent five classes (phenotypic plasticity, assisted migration, epigenetics, coral chimerism, holobiont modification) are detailed. It is concluded that the nursery phase of the ‘gardening’ tenet may further serve as a platform to enhance the adaptation capacities of corals to climate change through the five ABBR classes. Employing the ‘gardening’ tiers in reef restoration without considering ABRR will scarcely be able to meet global targets for healthy reef ecosystems in the future.

	Encompassing <0.1% of the ocean, coral reefs are the repository for approximately one-quarter of all ocean biodiversity, sustaining the livelihood of hundreds of millions of people through the ecosystem services they provide (Burke et al., 2011).

	changes via epigenetic may serve as a mechanismpromoting phenotypic plasticity that improves acclimatization capacity (Putnam et al., 2016).

	The literature indicates that inducible epigenetics cases do occur in reef corals. First, light or temperature stress may enhance stress tolerance of previously impacted colonies (Maynard et al., 2008; Guest et al., 2012),and an ‘environmental memory’ of such experiences may persist for decades (Brown et al., 2015). Second, several studies indicate that DNA methylation processes in reef building corals are reflective of the environment by responding to environmental changes, and above all, are heritable (Dixon et al., 2018; Liew et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Casariego et al., 2018; Durante et al., 2019). Third, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance was recorded in the branching coral species Pocillopora damicornis following exposure of adults to seawater acidification (Putnam et al., 2016), an epigenetic memory that was transferred to the offspring (Putnam and Gates, 2015).

	Yet, a significant increase in our under standing of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is needed before its employment as a ubiquitous restoration tool.
