title: Abstract
color:: 

Over the last four decades the Mexican Caribbean has experienced intensive coastal development, and change on the reef system condition has already been observed. This paper describes the reef system characteristics, at local and seascape scales, and discusses the current status and trends, considering the main research eﬀorts from academia and Non-Governmental Organizations. To date, the coral cover of most reefs in the region is between 15 and 20%, following a slight recovery on mean coral cover over the last decade. During this same period, ﬂeshy macroalgae and herbivorous ﬁsh biomass appear to have increased. At seascape scales, an increase of macroalgae and the loss of seagrass habitat have been observed. Considering that anthropogenic and environmental disturbances will most likely increase, the establishment of newly protected areas in the Mexican Caribbean is appropriate, but suﬃcient accompanying funding is required.
