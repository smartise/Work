title: Abstract
color:: 

Algal symbiont shuffling in favour of more thermotolerant species has been shown to enhance coral resistance to heat-stress. Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings and long-term implications of these changes are poorly understood. This work studied the modifications in coral DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism involved in coral acclimatization, in response to symbiont manipulation and subsequent heat stress exposure. Symbiont composition was manipulated in the great star coral Montastraea cavernosa through controlled thermal bleaching and recovery, producing paired ramets of three genets dominated by either their native symbionts (genus Cladocopium) or the thermotolerant species (Durusdinium trenchi). Single-base genome-wide analyses showed significant modifications in DNA methylation concentrated in intergenic regions, introns and transposable elements. Remarkably, DNA methylation changes in response to heat stress were dependent on the dominant symbiont, with twice as many differentially methylated regions found in heat-stressed corals hosting different symbionts (Cladocopium vs. D. trenchii) compared to all other comparisons. Interestingly, while differential gene body methylation was not correlated with gene expression, an enrichment in differentially methylated regions was evident in repetitive genome regions. Overall, these results suggest that changes in algal symbionts favouring heat tolerant associations are accompanied by changes in DNA methylation in the coral host. The implications of these results for coral adaptation, along with future avenues of research based on current knowledge gaps, are discussed in the present work.

	Several factors have been shown to modulate coral sensitivity to heat stress and promote acclimation/adaptation responses (i.e., genetic, epigenetic, symbiotic community composition and microbiome [Barshis, 2015; Eirin-Lopez & Putnam, 2019; Quigley et al., 2018]), leading to a wide spectrum of bleaching susceptibility patterns.

	Focusing on the symbiotic relationship, both the identity and population density of the symbiont appear to affect thermal sensitivity (Baker, 2004; Cunning & Baker, 2013; Silverstein et al., 2015; Swain et al., 2020).

	Current evidence of an increase and persistence of Durusdinium in natural coral populations, with a recent and rapid expansion through the Caribbean (Pettay et al., 2015), suggests a positive selection of this symbiotic partner under increasingly frequent thermal anomalies.

	In corals, several studies have already reported evidence of epigenetic responses to different types of environmental stressors such as thermal stress, ocean acidification, and eutrophication, among others (Putnam et al., 2016; Liew et al., 2018; Dimond et al., 2017; Putnam et al., 2016; Liew et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Casariego et al., 2018), as well as to broad environmental change (Rodríguez-Casariego et al., 2020; Dimond & Roberts, 2020; Durante et al., 2019; Liew et al., 2020), with links to transcriptional plasticity (Dixon et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018).

	Indeed, coral symbiont variants and abundance have been shown to significantly modulate gene expression in the host (Barfield et al., 2018; Helmkampf et al., 2019), including experiments where the intergenet variability (genet refers to the collection of fragments or “ramets'’ originating from the same colony [Cunning & Baker, 2020; DeSalvo et al., 2010]) was eliminated.

	Significant differences in global methylation (calculated as median methylation of all CpGs) due to thermal stress (F = 5.943, p = .0171), but not to symbiont manipulation (F = 0.572, p = .4519) or its interaction with thermal stress (F = 0.648, p = .4234) were observed using a two- way ANOVA, indicating that methylation is mainly affected by thermal stress, which cannot be shown in PCoA and variance partitioning..

	About 19% of all CpGs in the genome of M. cavernosa were methylated and primarily located in intergenic regions (>60% for all CpGs and methylated CpGs). This is comparable with the DNA methylation levels observed in other marine invertebrates (Gavery & Roberts, 2013; Strader et al., 2020; Venkataraman et al., 2020), including the relatively stress resistant corals Porites astreoides (Dimond & Roberts, 2020) and Montipora capitata (Trigg et al., 2021). Remarkably, methylation levels are significantly higher than those reported for the cnidarian model Aiptasia sp. (6.7%; [Li et al., 2018]), the stress-sensitive coral Stylophora pistillata (7%, [Liew et al., 2018]), and other corals of the robust clade like Pocillopora acuta (<10%; Trigg et al., 2021) and Acropora cervicornis (<10%; J. A. RodriguezCasariego, unpublished data).
