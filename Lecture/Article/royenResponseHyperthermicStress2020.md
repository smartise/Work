The symbiotic partnership between cnidarians and dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae constitutes the basis of remarkably diverse ecosystems, notably in tropical coral reefs. This tight association between the cnidarian host and the algal intracellular symbionts rests upon nutritional exchange between the two partners: the dinoflagellate algae supply photosynthetic products to their cnidarian host, which provide inorganic nutrients and shelter in return. However, this balance can be unsettled by environmental stressors, such as high water temperatures and acidity, leading to the collapse of the symbiotic partnership and threatening the survival of entire ecosystems. The impact of hyperthermic stress on these organisms, often called photosynthetic cnidarians, has been widely studied, specifically in reef-building corals. Nevertheless, the holobiont - the association of the host and its symbionts - displays a complex energy metabolism, involving respiration from both partners and photosynthesis from the symbionts, and the influence of heat stress on this compound system remains poorly understood, particularly in other dinoflagellates - cnidarians associations than corals. This thesis focuses on the bioenergetic response to heat stress in Mastigias papua jellyfish and Exaiptasia pallida anemones sampled in lakes and coves of the archipelago of Palau. With this aim in mind, we subjected these photosynthetic cnidarians to natural (28 °C and 31.5 °C) and elevated temperatures (35 °C) for seven days, and monitored the evolution of different parameters. Indeed, their general state was assessed (survival rate, fresh weight, bell pulse pace) as well as bioenergetic features (photosystems I and II activity, O2 exchanges). Our results indicate that subjecting M. papua jellyfish to hyperthermic stress negatively affects the complete holobiont, and specifically impacts the photosystem II of the symbionts. Besides, the jellyfish collected in different spots displayed distinct features and showed contrasting responses to elevated water temperature. Moreover, the E. pallida anemones showed a remarkably low resistance to heat stress, dying after two days, whereas M. papua  
jellyfish survived through one week at elevated temperature. Such disparities in the response to 
hyperthermic stress between two photosynthetic cnidarians thriving in the same ecosystem proves the importance of broadening the study of cnidarian - dinoflagellates symbiosis to their wide diversity.
