title: Abstract
color:: 

The survival of most reef-building corals is dependent upon a symbiosis between the coral and the community of Symbiodiniaceae.
            Montipora capitata
            , one of the main reef-building coral species in Hawai'i, is known to host a diversity of symbionts, but it remains unclear how they change spatially and whether environmental factors drive those changes. Here, we surveyed the Symbiodiniaceae community in 600
            M. capitata
            colonies from 30 sites across Kāne'ohe Bay and tested for host specificity and environmental gradients driving spatial patterns of algal symbiont distribution. We found that the Symbiodiniaceae community differed markedly across sites, with
            M. capitata
            in the most open-ocean (northern) site hosting few or none of the genus
            Durusdinium,
            whereas individuals at other sites had a mix of
            Durusdinium
            and
            Cladocopium
            . Our study shows that the algal symbiont community composition responds to fine-scale differences in environmental gradients; depth and temperature variability were the most significant predictor of Symbiodiniaceae community, although environmental factors measured in the study explained only about 20% of observed variation. Identifying and mapping Symbiodiniaceae community distribution at multiple scales is an important step in advancing our understanding of algal symbiont diversity, distribution and evolution and the potential responses of corals to future environmental change.
