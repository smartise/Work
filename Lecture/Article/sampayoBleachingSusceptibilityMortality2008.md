title: Abstract
color:: 

Coral bleaching has been identified as one of the major contributors to coral reef decline, and the occurrence of different symbionts determined by broad genetic groupings (clades A‚ÄìH) is commonly used to explain thermal responses of reef-building corals. By using
              Stylophora pistillata
              as a model, we monitored individual tagged colonies
              in situ
              over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic variability within clade C is correlated to differences in bleaching susceptibility. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2, visual bleaching assessments, symbiont densities, host protein, and pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, we show that subcladal types C78 and C8/a are more thermally tolerant than C79 and C35/a, which suffered significant bleaching and postbleaching mortality. Although additional symbiont types were detected during bleaching in colonies harboring types C79 and C35/a, all colonies reverted back to their original symbionts postbleaching. Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring thermally sensitive versus resistant symbionts rather than symbiont shuffling/switching within a single host is responsible for the observed symbiont composition changes of coral communities after bleaching. This study therefore highlights that the use of broad cladal designations may not be suitable to describe differences in bleaching susceptibility, and that differential mortality results in a loss of both symbiont and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing conditions.

	Highly variable patterns of bleaching have been recorded between and within geographic locations, host genera (7, 9, 10), and even within single species (11, 12). This variable response has been related to host factors (e.g., 13‚Äì15) and/or the presence of genetically distinct Symbiodinium types residing within the coral host.

	The Adaptive Bleaching Hypothesis (ABH; 30) has been proposed as a mechanism whereby reef-building corals switch or shuffle their algal symbionts for more tolerant varieties during bleaching and has been supported by studies that show increased thermal tolerance of novel associations (21) or that note increases of clade D within the community postbleaching (19, 31).
