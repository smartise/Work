title: Abstract
color:: 

Some reef-building corals have been shown to respond to environmental change by shifting the composition of their algal symbiont (genus
              Symbiodinium
              ) communities. These shifts have been proposed as a potential mechanism by which corals might survive climate stressors, such as increased temperatures. Conventional molecular methods suggest this adaptive capacity may not be widespread because few (‚àº25%) coral species have been found to associate with multiple
              Symbiodinium
              clades. However, these methods can fail to detect low abundance symbionts (typically less than 10‚Äì20% of the total algal symbiont community). To determine whether additional
              Symbiodinium
              clades are present, but are not detected using conventional techniques, we applied a high-resolution, real-time PCR assay to survey
              Symbiodinium
              (in clades A‚ÄìD) from 39 species of phylogenetically and geographically diverse scleractinian corals. This survey included 26 coral species thought to be restricted to hosting a single
              Symbiodinium
              clade (‚Äòsymbiotic specialists‚Äô). We detected at least two
              Symbiodinium
              clades (C and D) in at least one sample of all 39 coral species tested; all four
              Symbiodinium
              clades were detected in over half (54%) of the 26 symbiotic specialist coral species. Furthermore, on average, 68 per cent of all sampled colonies within a given coral species hosted two or more symbiont clades. We conclude that the ability to associate with multiple symbiont clades is common in scleractinian (stony) corals, and that, in coral‚Äìalgal symbiosis, ‚Äòspecificity‚Äô and ‚Äòflexibility‚Äô are relative terms: specificity is rarely absolute. The potential for reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to environmental change via symbiont community shifts may therefore be more phylogenetically widespread than has previously been assumed.

	Reef-building corals most commonly associate with Symbiodinium in clades A‚ÄìD [2], although members of clades F and G have also been reported [3,4] from these hosts.

	Within these Symbiodinium clades, over 400 distinct internal-transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) rDNA ‚Äòtypes‚Äô have been identified based on sequence differences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles [5‚Äì9], but it is not yet clear how many of these types represent distinct species [10,11].

	Physiological variability among Symbiodinium variants likely contributes to the ability of a coral host to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, such as gradients in depth, latitude, irradiance and temperature [20,25‚Äì28].

	Symbiodinium clade D has attracted particular interest in this regard because it includes opportunistic variants (e.g. ITS-2; types D1 and D1a) that can associate with hosts under conditions, such as temperature anomalies, that are typically sub-optimal for many members of other clades (reviewed by Baker [2] and Stat & Gates [29]).
