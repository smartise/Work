	Epigenetic responses to environmental stimuli could result in both short-term (mitotic) and long-term (meiotic) alterations in response to stress.

	There are many examples in which environmental cues, such as temperature, light, hypoxia, drought, salt stress, and pathogen response, have been linked to changes in epigenetic state, chromatin modifications, or DNA methylation [58‚Äì61]

	There is also growing evidence for transgenerational responses to environmental stress in plants. Recent studies have provided evidence for ‚Äòpriming‚Äô of responses to pathogen infection, notably potential transgenerational responses to pathogen infection in A. thaliana [73] that can be passed on to subsequent generations [74,75]. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and gene expression changes are associated with this response [76].
