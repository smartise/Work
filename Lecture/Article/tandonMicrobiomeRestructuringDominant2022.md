title: Abstract
color:: 

Bacteria in the coral microbiome play a crucial role in determining coral health and fitness, and the coral host often restructures its microbiome composition in response to external factors. An important but often neglected factor determining this microbiome restructuring is the ability of microbiome members to respond to changes in the environment. To address this issue, we examined how the microbiome structure of Acropora muricata corals changed over 9 months following a reciprocal transplant experiment. Using a combination of metabarcoding, genomics, and comparative genomics approaches, we found that coral colonies separated by a small distance harbored different dominant Endozoicomonas-related phylotypes belonging to two different species, including a novel species, “Candidatus Endozoicomonas penghunesis” 4G, whose chromosome-level (complete) genome was also sequenced in this study. Furthermore, the two dominant Endozoicomonas species had different potentials to scavenge reactive oxygen species, suggesting potential differences in responding to the environment. Differential capabilities of dominant members of the microbiome to respond to environmental change can (i) provide distinct advantages or disadvantages to coral hosts when subjected to changing environmental conditions and (ii) have positive or negative implications for future reefs.
IMPORTANCE The coral microbiome has been known to play a crucial role in host health. In recent years, we have known that the coral microbiome changes in response to external stressors and that coral hosts structure their microbiome in a host-specific manner. However, an important internal factor, the ability of microbiome members to respond to change, has been often neglected. In this study, we combine metabarcoding, culturing, and genomics to delineate the differential ability of two dominant Endozoicomonas species, including a novel “Ca. Endozoicomonas penghunesis” 4G, to respond to change in the environment following a reciprocal transplant experiment.

	For example, Ziegler and coworkers (31) studied variation in the microbiomes of the corals Acropora hemprichii and Pocillopora verrucosa in a long-term cross-transplantation experiment and identified that A. hemprichii harbors a highly flexible microbiome, whereas P. verrucosa has a remarkably stable microbiome, even after exposure to different levels of chronic pollution, suggesting that the bacterial communities of different coral species exhibit differential dynamics under environmental change/perturbation.
