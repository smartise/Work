title: Abstract
color:: 

When describing coral shape and form the term phenotypic plasticity, i.e. environment-induced changes in morphology, is often used synonymously with intraspecific variation. Variation, however, may simply be due to genetic differentiation (polymorphism). Of the 1314 extant scleractinian coral species, less than 20 have been tested for plastic responses. Morphological plasticity has important implications for coral identification, as skeletal features used in coral systematics are directly affected by environment. Furthermore, plastic changes can indicate how corals acclimatise to environmental change. The studies that have examined phenotypic plasticity in corals experimentally can be divided into two groups, i.e. ‚Äònon-clonal‚Äô‚Äîthose that have transplanted whole colonies or fragments of colonies (but not treated the fragments as clones) to new environments, and ‚Äòclonal‚Äô‚Äîthose that have transplanted colony fragments and used them as clone-mates. The use of clone-mates is preferable as it facilitates the identification of among-genotype variation for plasticity. The heterogeneous nature of the reef environment makes identifying the parameters that affect coral morphology difficult in the field, but there are also many problems conducting suitable aquarium experiments. Nevertheless, evidence to date suggests light and water movement are the most important variables inducing change. As these factors are known to be axiomatic to coral growth, it is possible that associated plastic changes in corals are adaptive; however, this hypothesis is yet to be tested rigorously.

	The first record of an induced change in a coral species is one of a single fragment of Agaricia fragilis (thin morphotype) attached to a tile by Vaughan (1911) that, over the course of one year, developed into the massive morphotype of this species.

	Convoluted forms became explanate in deep water and explanate forms became convoluted in shallow water. Willis (1985) concluded that light was the most important parameter influencing morphology in this species because explanate forms existed in shallow shaded areas whereas no convoluted forms at all were found at the deep sites.

	Muko et al. (2000) showed that high light intensities will induce branching in explanate forms of Porites sillimaniani by transplanting fragments from seven colonies to high and low light conditions (at the same depth, with light intensity controlled by screens). All colonies in the high light treatment began to develop branches within eight months whereas those in low light remained flat; however, the surviving sample size was not large enough for differences in response among genotypes to be identified.

	For instance, Bongiorni et al. (2003b) removed 40 branches (;3 cm) from each of 10 colonies of A. eurystoma and divided them between two sites, one exposed to fish-farm effluent, the other a control site. The racks of branches were moored at 6 m depth and left for seven months, after which time it was evident that the branches in the vicinity of the fish cages had

	grown much more quickly (Fig. 2). Although the images in Fig. 2 suggest morphological change, it is impossible to be sure whether or not the slower-growing fragments may eventually have looked identical to their faster-growing clones if left to reach the same size.

	Clones were grown in two different light/flow regimes and, even though the one in the high light/flow regime grew (laterally and upwardly) more slowly, when it did eventually reach the size of its clone-mate exposed to low light/flow, it had developed much thicker branches (Fig. 3).

	he relationship must result in an improvement in fitness, i.e. growth, reproduction, or survival (Stearns, 1989; Newman, 1992; Scheiner, 1993). Schmalhausen (1986) stressed that for plasticity to be adaptive it must have a historical basis, that is, populations need repeated exposure to particular environments to evolve a plastic response.

	Kaandorp (1999) and Kaandorp et al., (1996, 2003, 2005) have modelled the links between water flow, nutrient distribution, and branching. Kaandorp (1999) noted that the degree of compactness in Millepora alcicornis and Pocillopora damicornis (Fig. 7) increased with increasing water motion. This relationship of decreased branch spacing with increasing water flow has similarly been observed in Madracis mirabilis (Bruno & Edmunds, 1998). Lesser et al. (1994) also worked on P. damicornis and showed that, although ‚Äòhigh flow‚Äô colonies had thicker

	For example, Bongiorni et al. (2003ab) showed that suspended Stylophora pistillata nubbins grown near a fish farm, and thus subject to high levels of organic nutrients, grew faster than similar nubbins (clone-mates) kept at a control site.
