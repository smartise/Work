title: Abstract
color:: 

Size-dependant mortality influences the recolonization success of juvenile corals transplanted for reef restoration and assisting juvenile corals attain a refuge size would thus improve post-transplantation survivorship. To explore colony size augmentation strategies, recruits of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis were fed with live Artemia salina nauplii twice a week for 24 weeks in an ex situ coral nursery. Fed recruits grew significantly faster than unfed ones, with corals in the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 (control) nauplii/L groups exhibiting volumetric growth rates of 10.65¬±1.46, 4.69¬±0.9, 3.64¬±0.55 and 1.18¬±0.37 mm3/week, respectively. Corals supplied with the highest density of nauplii increased their ecological volume by more than 74 times their initial size, achieving a mean final volume of 248.38¬±33.44 mm3. The benefits of feeding were apparent even after transplantation to the reef. The corals in the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 nauplii/L groups grew to final sizes of 4875¬±260 mm3, 2036¬±627 mm3, 1066¬±70 mm3 and 512¬±116 mm3, respectively. The fed corals had significantly higher survival rates than the unfed ones after transplantation (63%, 59%, 56% and 38% for the 3600, 1800, 600 and 0 nauplii/L treatments respectively). Additionally, cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the costs per unit volumetric growth were drastically reduced with increasing feed densities. Corals fed with the highest density of nauplii were the most cost-effective (US$0.02/mm3), and were more than 12 times cheaper than the controls. This study demonstrated that nutrition enhancement can augment coral growth and post-transplantation survival, and is a biologically and economically viable option that can be used to supplement existing coral mariculture procedures and enhance reef restoration outcomes.

	In spite of these benefits, the cost of setting up and operating ex situ mariculture facilities can be very expensive [4]. For instance, the cost of maintaining juvenile coral culture in the Philippines for six months constitutes 42.9% of the total project expenditure [11] and this inevitably increases with labour costs [16].

	nsplantation. Size is an important determinant of survivorship in scleractinian corals and thus affects the rate of establishment of coral transplants on degraded reefs [17]. Smaller colonies tend to be more vulnerable since the refuge size required for surviving injuries arising from predation and incidental grazing is not yet attained [15,18].

	Various studies have demonstrated that photosynthetic and feeding rates could be increased by the manipulation of light intensity, flow rate and nutrient levels [25,26,27]. Although information on the effects of these manipulations on long-term coral growth rates is limited, the effects of nutritional enhancement are remarkably consistent for coral species from the families Faviidae, Acroporidae and Pocilloporidae.

	he survivorship and growth ‚Äì length (l), width (w) and height (h) ‚Äì of the 18 tagged coral juveniles in each replicate tank were measured using vernier calipers every four weeks and the ecological volume of each coral was estimated following the calculation for right cylindrical volumes, V = pr2h, where r =(l+w)/ 4 [38]. Weekly radial and volumetric growth were calculated by dividing the respective differences in colony radii and ecological volumes at the start of the ex situ feeding regime and at the end of the ex situ feeding regime (24 weeks).

	Since juvenile coral growth was proportionate to feed densities and the growth rates did not slow down even at 3600 nauplii/L, further increment of feeding densities and frequency would likely augment coral growth further.

	Additionally, as heterotrophy is known to play an important role in mitigating effects during stress events such as coral bleaching [41], introducing live feed during the early life stages can assist juvenile corals in attaining the required refuge size faster and cope with the effects of acute environmental stress.

	As survivorship increases with colony size [44], it is important to explore ways of accelerating the growth of juvenile corals in the least possible time.

	However, at 51%, the mean survival rate across treatments were more than four times higher than if juvenile corals of the same size class were to be transplanted to the field [17], underscoring the usefulness of feeding corals in ex situ mariculture to optimise restoration outcomes.

	More importantly, the growth rates of fed corals remained consistently higher than those of the unfed corals even after transplantation to the reef, suggesting the possibility that benefits obtained from the ex situ feeding regime will continue even after feeding has stopped.
