title: Abstract
color:: 

Prolonged thermal stress and high levels of solar irradiance can disrupt the coral-algal symbiosis and cause bleaching and lowered overall fitness that lead to the likely death of the cnidarian host. Adaptive bleaching and acclimatization of corals, which posits bleaching as an opportunity for the coral host to switch its currently susceptible endosymbionts to more stress-tolerant taxa, offers hope for survival of reefs amid rapidly warming oceans. In this study, we explored the diversity and distribution of coral-zooxanthellae associations in the context of geospatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) and thermal anomalies across the Philippine archipelago. Thermal clusters based on annual sea surface temperature means and each site‚Äôs frequency of exposure to heat stress were described using three-decade (1985‚Äì2018) remotely sensed data. Haphazard sampling of 628 coral fragments was conducted in 14 reef sites over 3 years (2015‚Äì2018). Using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting and sequencing of the zooxanthellae ITS2 region, we characterized endosymbiont diversity within four reef-building coral families across archipelagic thermal regimes. Consistency in dominant Symbiodiniaceae taxon was observed in
              Acropora
              spp.,
              Porites
              spp., and
              Heliopora coerulea
              . In contrast, the family Pocilloporidae (
              Pocillopora
              spp.,
              Seriatopora
              spp., and
              Stylophora pistillata
              ) exhibited biogeographic variability in zooxanthellae composition, concordant with inferred occurrences of sustained thermal stress. Multivariate analyses identify two broad Pocilloporidae clusters that correspond with mean SST ranges and frequency of exposure to bleaching-level thermal stress which are largely supported by ANOSIM. Differences in zooxanthellae assemblages may reflect host-specific responses to ecological or environmental gradients across biogeographic regions. Such patterns of variability provide insight and support for the adaptability and potential resilience of coral communities in geographically and oceanographically complex regions, especially amidst the increasing severity of global and local-scale stressors.

	Protozoan dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, colloquially known as zooxanthellae, are a diverse taxon of mostly endosymbiotic unicellular algae in marine invertebrates like corals, mollusks, and sponges

	In corals, the symbiotic relationship involves the host providing shelter and inorganic nutrients for the photoautotrophic zooxanthellae which assimilate and export back to the host high concentrations of oxygen for respiration and calcification and other photosynthates like glycerol, glucose, amino acids, and lipids, supplying more than 90% of the host‚Äôs metabolic requirements

	However, thermal stress and high levels of solar irradiance could disrupt the mutualistic relationship and cause bleaching and reduced fitness that lead to the likely death of the cnidarian host

	Although coral populations may respond variably to heat stress due to differences in local conditions (e.g., water flow, turbidity, sedimentation, etc.) and phenotypic plasticity, thermal stress is still predicted to be the major factor that will cause massive coral mortality in the foreseeable future

	Recurring bleaching events have been correlated with signs of acclimatization (i.e., increased tolerance to thermal stress) and lower mortality rates in several coral taxa, even in species expected to be more susceptible to bleaching (e.g., Acropora and Pocillopora spp.; Maynard et al., 2008; Guest et al., 2012).

	One prominent hypothesis for coral acclimatization centers on the algal endosymbiont and posits coral bleaching as an opportunity for the host to switch its currently susceptible symbionts with more stress-tolerant taxa like Durusdinium (formerly Symbiodinium clade D; LaJeunesse et al., 2018), ending up with a resilient holobiont geared for the conditions that caused the bleaching in the first place (Fautin and Buddemeier, 2004; Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006). Durusdinium glynnii and D. trenchii zooxanthellae can tolerate a wider range of water temperatures

	In many studies, these thermally tolerant zooxanthellae have been reported to reproduce from background concentrations within coral tissues (i.e., ‚Äúrare biosphere‚Äù; Boulotte et al., 2016), eventually overtaking its bleaching-susceptible predecessor, and dominating the coral colony post-bleaching

	sampling Pocillopora damicornis sensu lato from four thermally variable sites across the Indo-Pacific, reported warmer-site corals (Djibouti and French Polynesia) hosting stress resistant species of zooxanthellae (clade D1) and cooler-site corals (Taiwan and New Caledonia) harboring a less tolerant clade (Cladocopium goreaui, formerly Symbiodinium subclade C1).

	This reinforces the results of previous studies which also investigated the diversity of coral zooxanthellae assemblages at finer spatial scales across different host species and thermal variabilities and revealed the occurrence of thermally tolerant symbiont lineages in warmer or historically thermally stressed sites

	Moreover, it has been demonstrated that certain host-symbiont associations can be more labile than others (e.g., Pocillopora spp. are likelier to be shuffled with a tolerant species than the more stable Porites spp.) (Baker et al., 2013).
