title: Abstract
color:: 

The genetic enhancement of wild animals and plants for characteristics that benefit human populations has been practiced for thousands of years, resulting in impressive improvements in commercially valuable species. Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO
              2
              , resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.

	The genetic manipulation of biota through the translocation of species and populations and the release of captively bred or genetically modified (GM) organisms into the wild is sometimes criticized because of its potential to benefit some facets of an ecosystem, while simultaneously harming others.

	Some authors extend the definition of epigenetics to include the community of microbes associated with an organism (e.g., bacteria, algal endosymbionts, and viruses) (17) because microbial symbionts are able to influence the host phenotype.

	Vernalization, where plants require a prolonged period of exposure to cold to initiate the development of reproductive organs, is another example of a mitotically stable, environmentally induced epigenetic change (38).

	Further, natural variation in DNA methylation and small RNAs among individuals of several plant species has been documented, and such variants can be stable for hundreds of years (24). As a consequence, the notion of exploiting epigenetic mechanisms for stock improvement is gaining traction (24, 39).

	The high potential for transgenerational acclimatization is due to the fact that plants and corals commonly show asexual and sexual reproduction and that, in both groups, germ-line cells develop from totipotent somatic cells, which have been exposed to developmental and environmental cues throughout the individual‚Äôs life. These lifehistory traits are believed to have evolved in response to their sessile lifestyle, which requires a constant adjustment to environmental conditions because the organism is unable to relocate to a more suitable environment.

	strictly sexually reproducing organisms that have segregated germ and somatic cell lines and show DNA methylation resetting during gamete/ embryo development. Therefore, corals possess a variety of characteristics that make them likely candidate organisms for assisted evolution initiatives.
