color:: 

The development of novel functional food containing probiotics is a highly growing area of the food industry and attracts special interest from the field of nutrition, due to their beneficial properties to human health. The term probiotics is mainly referred to live microorganisms (especially lactic acid bacteria), which upon consumption provide health benefits to the host. On the other hand, prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates, which are nondigestible by humans and selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of probiotic microorganisms. More specifically, they pass by the small intestine to the lower gut where they are utilized by probiotic bacteria, but not by other intestinal bacteria. Probiotics and prebiotics are contained in several fermented food which are part of the traditional diet of humans for thousands of years. The nutraceuticals are commodities derived from food, but are used in the medicinal form of pills, capsules, or liquids and again render demonstrated physiological benefits. Nowadays, the tendency of using natural products that promote health is quite intensive. This category includes both nutraceuticals and herbal products as well as other natural products. Thus, the functionality of food, mainly of plant origin, could be an interchangeable tool to improve health and reduce disease risk through prevention. The subsection that refers to nutraceuticals will include terms and definitions, food sources of nutraceuticals, examples and case studies, legislation, uses and safety, and more yet the topic of promising and economics of nutraceuticals as alternative medicinal products. GMO food are produced from genetically modified organisms. The latter have undergone specific changes in their genetic material by means of genetic engineering methods. They first entered the market in 1996. GM food are products of transgenic plants such as soybeans, corn, rice, tomato, and cotton. In recent years, foodstuffs produced in this way have faced a lot of criticism related to various factors such as safety, ecology, and economic issues. Benefits and fears related to GM food will be analyzed. Moreover, the recent regulations regarding GM food will be outlined.
