Abstract
            
              The mutualistic relationship existing between scleractinian corals and their photosynthetic endosymbionts involves a complex integration of the metabolic pathways within the holobiont. Respiration and photosynthesis are the most important of these processes and although they have been extensively studied, our understanding of their interactions and regulatory mechanisms is still limited. In this work we performed chlorophyll-
              a
              fluorescence, oxygen exchange and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy measurements on small and thin fragments (0.3 cm
              2
              ) of the coral
              Stylophora pistillata
              . We showed that the capacity of mitochondrial alternative oxidase accounted for ca. 25% of total coral respiration, and that the high-light dependent oxygen uptake, commonly present in isolated Symbiodiniaceae, was negligible. The ratio between photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) active centers as well as their respective electron transport rates, indicated that PSI cyclic electron flow occurred in high light in
              S. pistillata
              and in some branching and lamellar coral species freshly collected in the field. Altogether, these results show the potential of applying advanced biophysical and spectroscopic methods on small coral fragments to understand the complex mechanisms of coral photosynthesis and respiration and their responses to environmental changes.
