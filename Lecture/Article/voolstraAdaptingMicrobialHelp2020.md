	In particular hermatypic corals (Cnidaria: Anthozoa), which are the foundation species of the ecologically and economically important coral reef ecosystems,[6,7] are ‚Äúposter child‚Äù metaorganisms, given their general reliance on an obligate endosymbiotic relationship with photosynthetic microalgae in the family Symbiodiniaceae[8] (Figure 1). This partnership comprises the engine of the reef,[9] as it allows corals, fueled by microalgal photosynthates, to build their skeletons that give rise to the massive 3D calcium carbonate frameworks that serve as a habitat for millions of species.[7,10]

	Besides microalgae, corals associate with a suite of bacteria, fungi, and viruses (among others) collectively referred to as the coral holobiont.[2‚Äì5,11]

	Given the strong reliance of corals on their associated microbes, two compelling theories have been formulated that emphasize the importance of partner exchange under changing environmental conditions: the adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH),[19] which states that coral bleaching (i.e., the loss of microalgae from coral tissues triggered by stress) allows a host to associate with different partners; and the coral probiotic hypothesis (CPH)[20] that posits that a dynamic relationship between microbial partners and environmental conditions exists, which selects for the most advantageous coral holobiont composition.

	coral holobiont adaptation. This is due to a variety of reasons. With regard to the microalgal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) neither the methodological (i.e., high-throughput sequencing), nor the taxonomic or the analytical framework were available to generate conclusive data that coral hosts can either ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù their or engage with novel microalgal symbionts as a consequence of bleaching.

	Conversely to the overall stable and exclusive coral‚Äìmicroalgal associations, coral-associated bacteria are commonly much more diverse (on the order of 102‚Äì104 distinct bacterial taxa per coral host) and more evenly distributed.[40] Nevertheless, exceptions exist. For instance, corals abundantly associate with bacteria of the genus Endozoicomonas that can approach in extreme cases up to 90% of the relative bacterial abundance (based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing).[41‚Äì44

	Ziegler et al.[50] used corals from the genera Acropora (suspected to harbor rather variable bacterial associations) and Pocillopora (found to maintain largely invariant bacterial microbiomes) to conduct a large-scale environmental transplant study to systematically assess whether the degree of microbiome flexibility (i.e., the ability to harbor different bacterial communities; Box 1) differs between coral species.

	 Conversely, the bacterial microbiome of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa remained remarkably stable, irrespective of the prevailing environment that coral fragments were transplanted to. In the following, we argue that this observed microbiome flexibility is a broad(er) phenomenon that supports metaorganism adaptation to rapid

	different degrees of microbiome flexibility may thus be a reflection of distinct holobiont ecological adaptation strategies (Figure 2). High microbiome flexibility (i.e., restructuring of the microbial community through gain and/or loss of taxa) presumably promotes rapid metaorganism adaptation to environmental changes, but at the risk of losing putatively essential associates. Depending on the functional redundancy of the original community composition, the functions provided by replaced or excluded taxa may also be lost.

	Corals with low microbiome flexibility presumably harbor high physiological plasticity, whereas species with high microbiome flexibility harbor low physiological plasticity. Accordingly, peak ecological adaptation capacity, relevant for organisms threatened by climate change, may be reached if physiological plasticity and microbiome flexibility are maximized. It is currently unknown through which mechanisms this may be achieved, but recent studies have shown the promise of probiotics,[65,70] environmental priming,[15,50,71,72] or even genetic engineering.[73] It is also unknown if species exist that exhibit low physiological plasticity and low microbiome flexibility, which may represent valuable study systems for our understanding of environmental resilience

	reorganization of flexible microbiomes may supposedly open the door to pathogen invasion during unstable phases of microbiome transition and render the host species more susceptible to disease. This hypothesis is supported by high disease incidence[67] and susceptibility[68,69] in Acroporid corals with high microbiome flexibility and the general dearth of coral disease in Pocilloporid corals with low microbiome flexibility.[67] Low microbiome flexibility presumably supports stable relationships with essential microbial associates and their inherent functions, but at the cost of low capacity for rapid microbiome adaptation and potential functional collapse in the absence of functional redundancy.

	High functional redundancy of the bacterial community thus represents one potential factor promoting high microbiome flexibility, whereby environmental stress leads to selective pressure between functionally redundant taxa.[75] In this scenario, shifts in microbiome composition may occur without risking to lose important functions and enable rapid metaorganism adaptation.

	Ziegler et al.[50] also found that the remaining bacterial community of Pocillopora corals after exclusion of the Endozoicomonadaceae bacterial family was even more stable than that of Acropora corals, indicating a potential stabilizing effect of the dominant taxon on the community beyond its own presence.

	Other studies have shown that under certain conditions, the dominance of one taxon may have a stabilizing effect on the entire bacterial community through effects on host immunity (reviewed in[76,77])orregulation of quorum sensing and quenching (reviewed in[78]).

	Interestingly, the microbiome of Acropora corals was also associated with Endozoicomonadaceae, but the association was less stable. This suggests that the same bacterial taxon can exhibit different relationship characteristics in different coral species.

	Notably, flexibility in terms of changing community composition as alluded above is not the only mechanism for microbiomes to functionally adapt.[4,21] For instance, deep-sea mussels harbor multiple strains of the same bacterial taxon with different functional profiles, suggesting potential for shuffling at the strain or population level (inaccessible through means of 16S metabarcoding approaches).[79]

	Nevertheless, the precise time it takes for microbial associations to change or ‚Äúadapt‚Äù is not known and may differ depending on environmental pressure and host species. Presumably, it can be very fast, in the course of hours, as experiments with short-term acute heat stress assays may suggest.[15]

	However, if bacteria ‚Äúwork well‚Äù in a given environment, they might also be successful in that same environment, and specificity does not need to be absolute. Evidence for this may come from coral probiotics experiments,[65,70] where so called Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals (BMCs),[64] that is, ‚Äúcocktails‚Äù of bacterial strains with putative beneficial functions to the host, are applied to a coral, which subsequently becomes more stress resilient

	Another point of clarification lies in the role of ‚Äúfounder effects‚Äù of colonization, that is, if bacteria which are already present determine what other bacteria may associate.[90] In the case of corals, several research groups now work with antibiotics to deplete the native microbiome.[91,92] The idea here is that, using antibiotics (or cocktails thereof), corals or coral larvae can be largely freed from bacteria; this then allows to reinoculate such gnotobiotic or ideally axenic corals with bacterial isolates to determine if the nature or order of isolates determine the bacteria that associate thereafter.[66,93] For instance, using P. verrucosa the conjecture would be that association with the highly dominant and stable Endozoicomonas would affect the type of bacteria that associate thereafter. More broadly, this avenue of research would allow to study how access to selected bacteria initially may determine the shape of the microbiome then-after (Box 3).

	Conversely, animal cells only have membranes as a barrier to the outside world, although many animal surfaces feature a mucus/mucoid layer. The mammal gut,[95,96] the surface of the freshwater polyp Hydra,[97] or coral tissue[91] are all covered by mucus sheets or layers and this is where a lot of microbes reside. In line with this, coral studies that differentiated between the microbial communities associated with the host tissue and mucus found prevalent differences between the two,[98,99] whereby tissue-associated bacteria more strongly reflect host traits in comparison to mucusassociated communities, which align better with the prevailing environment and ecology of a coral host.[16] Surprisingly, skeletalassociated communities harbored the largest diversity,[16] emphasizing that although coral mucus is the compartment exposed to the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù, microbial communities are not a mere reflection of the prevailing environment (see above).

	For instance, a recent study showed significant differences in the prokaryotic communities associated with coral recruits pending exposure to the mucusassociated microbes of four different coral species.[101] As such, transplantation of the mucus from one host to another seems to change specificity of bacterial association, although it remains to be determined if microbiome flexibility can be changed through such a procedure as well.

	Interactions between members of the metaorganism that potentially do not involve the coral host, as for example between microalgae and bacteria,[102‚Äì104] add another layer of complexity. Based on the first description of bacterial microbiome flexibility in corals of the genera Acropora and Pocillopora,[50] the corresponding microalgal communities of these hosts seem to follow similar patterns of flexibility, and exhibit higher flexibility of Acropora‚Äôs microalgae communities than those of Pocillopora.[105]

	This is explained by the bacteriophage adherence to mucus (BAM) model,[117] which suggests that metazoan mucosal surfaces and phages coevolve to maintain phage adherence. For the host, this provides a mechanism to limit or control bacterial adhesion, whereas the phage benefits through more frequent interactions with potential bacterial hosts. This implies that virus/bacteriophage communities might be a direct component structuring microbial community assemblage. In line with the above study, coral mucus seems to represent a hot spot for viruses and phages,[118] and it would be compelling to show whether microbiome flexibility can be affected by phage manipulation. That phage therapy (i.e., inoculation of bacteriophages which target specific bacteria) can change microbial community structure in an effort to target pathogenic bacteria has been shown to work in principle by Efrony et al.[116] However, it remains to be shown whether microbiome regulators can be converted into microbiome conformers (Box 1) and vice versa via viral manipulation, which would impact our understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying microbiome flexibility.
