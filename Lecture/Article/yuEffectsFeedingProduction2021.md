title: Abstract
color:: 

To meet the emerging demand of corals in various industries, it is necessary to develop an optimal technique to improve coral growth and health. Since heterotrophy provides a vital source of nutrients for corals, it is possible to implement a cultivation pattern combining regular methods with artificial feeding for corals. To this end, this study investigated the effects of feeding (supplemented with Artemia salina nauplii) on the production (growth and budding rate), body composition (tissue protein, crude lipid, and ash contents), and fatty acid profile (total fatty acid and polar lipid fatty acid profiles) of scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis in polyp morphology. Our results showed that feeding increased the production of G. fascicularis, with fed corals exhibiting a 51.4% higher growth rate and a double budding rate. Meanwhile, feeding changed the body composition of G. fascicularis, with increased tissue protein and crude lipid contents by 69.8%, and 31.0%, respectively, which indicated a good assimilation of supplementary proteins and lipids via feeding. Moreover, feeding also significantly changed the total FA profile of G. fascicularis, as it improved the levels of monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (mainly n-3 PUFAs and n-6 PUFAs), but decreased the proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (mainly 16:0). However, there was no significant difference in the polar lipid FA composition of G. fascicularis between the two feeding regimes. This study highlights substantial improvements in the physioÂ­ logical state and health condition of corals under artificial feeding, and demonstrates that A. salina nauplii can serve as a suitable nutrient source for G. fascicularis in aquaculture.
