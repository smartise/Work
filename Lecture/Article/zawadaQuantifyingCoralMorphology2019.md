title: Abstract
color:: 

Coral morphology has important implications across scales, from differences in physiology, to the environments they are found, through to their role as ecosystem engineers. However, quantifying morphology across taxa is difficult, and so morphological variation is typically captured via coarse growth form categories (e.g. arborescent and massive). In this study, we develop an approach for quantifying coral morphology by identifying continuous three-dimensional shape variables. To do so, we contrast six variables estimated from 152 laser scans of coral colonies that ranged across seven growth form categories and three orders of magnitude of size. We found that 88% of the variation in shape was captured by two principal components. The main component was variation in volume compactness (cf. convexity), and the second component was a trade-off between surface complexity and top-heaviness. Variation in volume compactness also limited variation along the second axis, where surface complexity and top-heaviness ranged more freely when compactness was low. Traditional growth form categories occupied distinct regions within this morphospace; however, these regions overlapped due to scaling of shape variables with colony size. Nonetheless, with four of the shape variables we were able to predict traditional growth form categories with 70 to 95% accuracy, suggesting that the continuous variables captured most of the qualitative variations implied by these growth forms. Distilling coral morphology into continuous variables that capture shape variation will allow for better tests of the mechanisms that govern coral biology, ecology and ecosystem services such as reef building and provision of habitat.

	These characteristics have consequences for vital processes such as growth and survival, where higher surface area-to-volume ratios allow more biomass per unit investment in skeleton, but may increase the risk of partial colony mortality (Lirman 2000), dislodgement (Madin 2005), and susceptibility to thermal bleaching

	However, many sessile colonial organisms within marine environments are subjected to hydrodynamic forces that can dislodge entire colonies if they grow too far away from the substrate, restricting the range of available morphologies (Koehl 1999).

	Two variables that can capture volume compactness are convexity and sphericity, where convexity captures the ratio of the objects volume to the volume immediately surrounding it, and sphericity which captures how close an objects shape is to a sphere, which is the most compact shape possible in three dimensions.

	For each colony mesh, we calculated two size variables, volume and surface area, and six shape variables that pair off into three axes of shape variation: sphericity and convexity (capturing volume compactness), packing and fractal dimension (capturing surface complexity) and the first moments of area and volume (capturing top-heaviness).

	Volume compactness is captured here by two variables. Sphericity S is a size invariant measure of the compactness of an object‚Äôs volume (Wadell 1935). It is calculated as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the object and the surface area of the object.

	Convexity C is a size invariant measure of the degree to which there is space between different parts of an object (Zunic and Rosin 2004). Convexity is calculated as the volume of an object divided by the volume of its convex hull, where the convex hull is the shape formed by the smallest possible boundary that has no concave areas around an object (Barber et al. 1996).

	Surface complexity is also captured by two shape variables. Another form of convexity (which we call packing P for clarity) is a size invariant ratio of how much of an object‚Äôs surface area is situated internally versus externally in relation to its immediate environment (Zunic and Rosin 2004). It is calculated as the surface area of an object divided by the surface area of its convex hull. A packing value above one indicates that surface area is packed within the volume it occupies (i.e. it is more inverted). Values below one indicate that surface area is more spread out over the volume it occupies (i.e. it is more everted). Convex shapes have a packing equal to one, as the surface area is neither internally nor externally distributed, and objects with an equivalent amount of ‚Äò‚Äòinverted‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòeverted‚Äô‚Äô surface also have a packing equal to one. As packing is a proportion that can go above or below 1, it was log10 transformed for analyses. Fractal dimension D captures how surface area fills space and is an estimate of spatial complexity.

	Top-heaviness was captured by the first moments of volume (VVOL) and surface area (VAREA) with respect to the vertical distance from the attachment area. For VAREA, the area of each triangle in the mesh was calculated and multiplied by the vertical distance from the centroid of the triangle and the centroid of the attachment plane. For VVOL, a similar algorithm was used. For each triangle in the mesh, a tetrahedron between the triangle and the origin was calculated. The signed volume of each tetrahedron was multiplied by the vertical distance between the centroid of the tetrahedron and the centroid of the attachment plane. Both variables were log10 transformed for analysis. To ensure size invariance, colony meshes were converted to a standard volume of 1 mm3 before these variables were calculated.

	Variation in surface complexity is related to competition and resource use, where colonies with their surfaces distributed in a complex way have less resources (e.g. light, nutrients) per unit surface area but can have more polyps packed within a given space (Wangpraseurt et al. 2012).
