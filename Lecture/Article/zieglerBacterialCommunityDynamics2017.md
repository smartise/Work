Abstract
            Ocean warming threatens corals and the coral reef ecosystem. Nevertheless, corals can be adapted to their thermal environment and inherit heat tolerance across generations. In addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally variable habitats and changes over time when corals are reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term heat stress experiment. Such associations could result from parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to living at high natural temperatures. A competing hypothesis is that the microbial community and coral heat tolerance are causally linked.

	In particular, long-lived sessile stony corals are dependent on an endosymbiosis with photosynthetic algal symbionts in the genus Symbiodinium5 and, more recently, are shown to associate with a diverse set of bacteria that contribute important functions to the coral host6‚Äì8.

	Reciprocal transplantation of coral colonies between the two thermally distinct environments strikingly demonstrated that coral microbial communities fully adjusted to the new environmental conditions: 17 months after transplantation, the microbiomes of non-native corals transplanted into each pool could not be distinguished from the microbiomes of the native corals in the same pool

	However, the microbiome of MV corals did not become more similar to those of naturally heat-stressed HV corals, as detected by SIMilarity PERcentage (SIMPER) analysis (Supplementary Data 4). In contrast, coral colonies that had lived in the warmer, more variable environment (i.e., the HV pool) bleached less and maintained their original microbial communities. They were more resistant to the heat stress and their microbiome showed no significant response after 5 and 20 h compared with control corals

	At large, HV coral microbiomes were characterized by enrichment of functions related to metabolism (Supplementary Data 5). At the level of proteins (Table 1), several functions related to carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in HV corals, such as multiple proteins of the sugar transport system, specifically three fructose transport proteins, one ribose transport protein, and a fucose mutarotase enzyme (Table 1). Other enriched proteins in HV coral microbiomes included the nitrogen-fixation protein NifW, the reactive oxygen species-scavenger ferredoxin, and the bacterial chaperonin GroES (Table 1). Only three functions were enriched in MV coral microbiomes, two proteins aiding the transfer of functional groups between molecules and a bacterial exonuclease (Table 1).

	About two-thirds of the indicator OTUs in the HV pool belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria; the remaining OTUs belonged to the classes Cytophagia, Deltaproteobacteria, Phycisphaerae, Spirochaetes, and only one OTU belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 2a).

	These OTUs were not (or only rarely) present in corals from the MV pool that displayed a response to heat stress. Further analyses focusing on the 20 h heat-stressed samples in comparison with all other treatment groups (i.e., 5 and 20 h controls and 5 h heat stress) revealed that microbial communities of corals from the HV pool had no distinct bacterial indicator taxa, while the same treatment group from the MV pool had 10 indicator OTUs that were characteristic of the heat-induced microbial shift in these more susceptible corals (Fig. 2b). The heat-stressed corals from the MV pool were characterized by members of the bacterial classes Gammaproteobacteria and Saprospirae, some of which were previously encountered in heat stressed or diseased tissues of marine organisms (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 3).

	In HV corals, Alphaproteobacteria were responsible for a large fraction of the functional enrichment, with the family Rhodospirillaceae and the genus Inquilinus as prevalent contributors. In contrast, in MV corals Gammaproteobacteria were predominately associated with enriched functional profiles.

	Native coral colonies in the two pools had different microbial communities. Moreover, after 17 months of transplantation, microbiomes of non-native corals transplanted into each pool adjusted to the new environmental conditions and were not significantly different from native corals in the same pool. In a short-term heat stress experiment, the microbial community responded within 20 h for corals that had been transplanted to a more stable, cooler environment. But colonies living in the warmer, more variable environment for 17 months bleached less and maintained their microbial communities. The robust and stable microbiome of corals from the highly variable HV pool was characterized by a consistent set of microbial taxa across all control and heat treatments that were not (or only rarely) present in the susceptible corals transplanted to the more stable, cooler MV pool.

	Nevertheless, while we did not transfer microbiomes between HV and MV corals, the long-term transplantation effectively resulted in HV corals harbouring an MV microbiome and MV corals harbouring an HV microbiome associated with higher and lower susceptibility to coral bleaching, respectively.

	Taxonomy-based functional profiling of the distinct microbial communities of HV and MV corals provided insight into the associated cellular processes underlying the differences in the coral heat stress response. Following the differences in microbial community composition, functional profiles were different between HV and MV corals, with an enrichment of several protein functions related to carbohydrate metabolism in HV coral microbiomes. These may represent signatures of bacterial heat tolerance, as indicated by the role of altered carbohydrate composition in the mucus of heat-stressed corals25. In this regard, an enzyme of Fucose, shown to undergo the largest increase of carbohydrates in coral mucus under heat stress25, was enriched in HV corals from our study. We found three additional proteins that are part of the Fructose transport system to be enriched in HV corals. In support of these results, carbohydrate transport and metabolism (for example, the enzyme fructose-1phosphate kinase) are under strong regulation in Streptococcus mutans to cope with heat stress26. Other enriched proteins that provide a link to increased thermal tolerance of bacteria in HV corals included the nitrogen-fixation protein NifW27, ferredoxin, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species that increases heat tolerance in Chlamydomonas28 and also in coral larvae29,30, and the bacterial chaperonin GroES, which is a homologue to Hsp10 and assists in correct folding of proteins under heat stress31. These data support a functional restructuring of the microbial metabolic network in stress-resistant corals32.

	Integrating the results of the different analyses, Alphaproteobacteria were responsible for a large fraction of the functional enrichment in the HV pool, with the family Rhodospirillaceae and the genus Inquilinus as prevalent contributors. This observation relates well with the significantly higher abundance of Rhodospirillaceae in the HV pool and the identification of indicator bacteria from the genus Inquilinus in the HV pool, and thus suggests a possible role of Rhodospirillaceae in the thermal tolerance of the corals. Encountering the bacterium Inquilinus in the heat-tolerant corals may seem unusual, because it has been initially isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. So far, Inquilinus has very rarely been reported from other environments33 and its putative role in corals requires experimental verification.

	The main contributing families in the Gammaproteobacteria were Hahellaceae, containing the wellknown coral symbiont Endozoicomonas19,35, and Alteromonadaceae, which was represented by strain BD2-13 and the genera Alteromonas and Glaciecola. Members of Glaciecola are better known for their occurrence in polar regions and the cold adaptation of their genomes36, representing another link to the differences in thermal tolerance between the different environments of the HV and MV pools. A third family of Gammaproteobacteria that comprises many disease agents and sources of virulence for corals, the Vibrionaceae, further contributed to the functional profile of microbial communities in the MV pool. Among them was Vibrio shilonii, a bacterium that has been associated with coral bleaching in the coral Oculina patagonica37,38, providing another possible connection to the higher incidence of bleaching of the MV corals during the heat stress experiment.

	Ten colonies of A. hyacinthus (var. surculosa) from the south lagoon of Ofu Island, American Samoa (14¬∞11‚ÄôS, 169¬∞36‚ÄôW) were collected from each of two locations with different natural temperature regimes, an HV pool and an MV pool, in July 2011. The colonies were fragmented into 240 nubbins and distributed on 12 egg-crate platforms with the same 20 genotypes per platform, 10 genotypes from each pool environment22. Six of these platforms were transplanted into each pool. After 17 months of acclimatization to the different pool environments, a subset of visually healthy coral nubbins was used in a bleaching experiment in the laboratory.
