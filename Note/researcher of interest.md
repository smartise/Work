Dear Miss Férrier-Page,

My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently graduated from the University of Liège (Belgium) with a master's degree in Oceanography in September 2022. This year, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama on two different projects: "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis," together with Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni. While working on these projects, I have had the opportunity to read some of your work, especially the one you carried out in partnership with Laura (one of my supervisors), such as "Symbiont regulation in Stylophora pistillata during cold stress" or your work on the effects of nitrate and ammonium on coral bleaching. I am quite fond of the work you are doing.

Next year, I wish to continue my academic training by pursuing a Ph.D. and was wondering if you have any positions available. Although I don't have funding for a Ph.D., I am incredibly motivated and committed to pursuing it.

Apart from my year-long internship at STRI, I have also had the chance to work on different projects during my studies. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University). I worked on the effect of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata through fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored many different facets of marine biology. I was part of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) with Dr. Flammang, studying the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. I also participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), working on the identification of marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, such as the sponge Stylissa carteri.

Broadly, I am very interested in studying coral ecology and conservation in the face of a changing climate and increased environmental stressors. I am especially interested in finding ways to improve reef conservation through breeding methods or learning from their adaptation through research, as in my present project. I would like to pursue a career in coral reef research and conservation, developing new ways to better prepare the reefs for upcoming environmental events and learning more about their fascinating biology. I am passionate about communicating and sharing science with the public and hope to also work in community involvement and outreach.

I would very much like to learn more about your research and lab in more depth. Would it be possible to set up a time to speak with you about potential opportunities, possibly over the phone or via Zoom? I have also attached my CV and transcript. Please let me know if there is a time that is most convenient for you.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Collard Olivier
