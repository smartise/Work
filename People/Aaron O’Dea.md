"My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently graduated from the University of Liège (Belgium) with a master's degree in Oceanography in September 2022. This year, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama on two different projects: "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis," together with Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni. "

here express how i find the research about "" interesting 

keep this paragraph: "Apart from my year-long internship at STRI, I have also had the chance to work on different projects during my studies. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University). I worked on the effect of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata through fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored many different facets of marine biology. I was part of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) with Dr. Flammang, studying the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. I also participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), working on the identification of marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, such as the sponge Stylissa carteri."

here express how i am deeply intersted in marine biology and i would like to continue my career by pursuing a Ph.D
