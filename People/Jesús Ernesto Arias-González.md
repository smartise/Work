create a mail destinated to Jesús Ernesto Arias-González to ask if there is a Ph.D position in the lab 

take in consideration:

- the person to whom i'm writing to is a men 
- don't change the order of the paragraph
- keep it simple

keep this paragraphe:  
"My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently graduated from the University of Liège (Belgium) with a master's degree in Oceanography in September 2022. This year, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama on two different projects: "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis," together with Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni. "

here express that is had the opportunity to read some of her works during my work here particulary the one talking about your study on heat stress exposure in Caribbean coral reefs to enhance conservation and the science based corals reef resotration solutions

keep this paragraph: "Apart from my year-long internship at STRI, I have also had the chance to work on different projects during my studies. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University). I worked on the effect of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata through fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored many different facets of marine biology. I was part of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) with Dr. Flammang, studying the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. I also participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), working on the identification of marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, such as the sponge Stylissa carteri."

here express how i am deeply intersted in marine biology and i would like to continue my career by pursuing a Ph.D

I have also attached my CV and transcript.

Subject: Inquiry about Ph.D. Position in Your Lab

Dear Mr. Jesús Ernesto Arias-González,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently completed my master's degree in Oceanography at the University of Liège (Belgium) in September 2022. Currently, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, where I am involved in two exciting projects: "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis." These projects are conducted in collaboration with Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni.

During my time at STRI, I had the opportunity to read some of your research papers, particularly the one focusing on heat stress exposure in Caribbean coral reefs to enhance conservation and the science-based coral reef restoration solutions. Your study deeply intrigued me, and I greatly admire your dedication to the field of marine science.

In addition to my year-long internship at STRI, I have been fortunate to work on various projects during my academic journey. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University), where I investigated the effect of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata through fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored various facets of marine biology. I was a member of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) under the guidance of Dr. Flammang, where I studied the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. Additionally, I participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), focusing on the identification of marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, including the sponge Stylissa carteri.

My deep interest in marine biology and my passion for scientific research have fueled my ambition to pursue a Ph.D. I am writing to inquire if there are any available Ph.D. positions in your lab. I believe that my academic background, research experiences, and enthusiasm make me a strong candidate for such a position.

For your convenience, I have attached my CV and transcript, which provide more detailed information about my academic achievements and research experiences.

Thank you for considering my inquiry. I sincerely appreciate your time and would be grateful for any information you can provide regarding potential Ph.D. opportunities or any guidance on the application process.

I look forward to the possibility of joining your lab and contributing to the impactful research conducted under your guidance.

Yours sincerely,

Olivier Collard
