create a mail destinated to Dr. Sonia Bejarano to ask if there is a Ph.D position in the lab 


take in consideration: 
- the person to whom i'm writing to is a women
- don't change the order of the paragraph
- keep it simple

keep this paragraphe:
"My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently graduated from the University of Liège (Belgium) with a master's degree in Oceanography in September 2022. This year, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama on two different projects: "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis," together with Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni. "

here express that is had the opportunity to read some of her works during my work here  particulary the one talking about  "short-term effect of sinking microplastics on heterotrophy or sediment clearing in the tropical coral Stylophora pistillata" 

keep this paragraph: "Apart from my year-long internship at STRI, I have also had the chance to work on different projects during my studies. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University). I worked on the effect of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata through fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored many different facets of marine biology. I was part of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) with Dr. Flammang, studying the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. I also participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), working on the identification of marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, such as the sponge Stylissa carteri."

here express how i am deeply intersted in marine biology and i would like to continue my career by pursuing a Ph.D

I have also attached my CV and transcript.

Subject: Inquiry about Ph.D. Position in Your Lab

Dear Dr. Sonia Bejarano,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently completed my master's degree in Oceanography at the University of Liège (Belgium) in September 2022. Currently, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, where I have been involved in two projects titled "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis." These projects have provided me with valuable research experience working alongside Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni.

During my time at STRI, I had the opportunity to read some of your research papers, particularly the one discussing the "short-term effect of sinking microplastics on heterotrophy or sediment clearing in the tropical coral Stylophora pistillata." Your work has greatly impressed me, and I admire your contributions to the field.

In addition to my internship at STRI, I have engaged in various projects throughout my academic journey. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University), where I investigated the impact of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata using fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

As an undergraduate, I explored diverse facets of marine biology. I had the privilege of being part of the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) with Dr. Flammang, focusing on the study of proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. Additionally, I participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), where I worked on identifying marine antifouling compounds from marine resources, specifically the sponge Stylissa carteri.

My profound interest in marine biology and my passion for conducting meaningful research have driven me to pursue a Ph.D. I am eager to continue my academic journey and contribute to the field. Therefore, I am reaching out to inquire if there are any Ph.D. positions available in your lab. I am confident that my academic background, research experience, and dedication make me a suitable candidate for such a position.

For your convenience, I have attached my CV and transcript, which provide detailed information about my academic achievements and research experiences.

Thank you for considering my inquiry. I appreciate your time and would be grateful for any information you can provide regarding potential Ph.D. opportunities or guidance on how to proceed.

I look forward to the possibility of joining your lab and contributing to the exciting research conducted under your mentorship.

Yours sincerely,

Olivier Collard
