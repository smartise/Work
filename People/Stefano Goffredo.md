Dear Mr. Stefano Goffredo,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Olivier Collard, and I recently graduated from the University of Liège (Belgium) with a master's degree in Oceanography in September 2022. Currently, I am working as an intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, collaborating on two research projects titled "The variation of Pocillopora spp Symbiodiniacea assemblage with temperature and salinity fluctuation across the Tropical Eastern Pacific of Panama" and "The effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral Acropora Cervicornis." These projects are supervised by Dr. Matthieu Leray, Dr. Diana Lopez, and Dr. Laura F. B. Marangoni.

I would like to express my interest in PhD's position on the subject. "Strategies of resilience of calcifying marine organisms to different environmental conditions: fundamentals and technological applications." The opportunity to work in your esteemed lab would be a tremendous privilege, and I believe it aligns perfectly with my academic background and research interests.

In addition to my internship at STRI, I have gained valuable experience through various projects during my academic studies. For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Prof. Dr. Cardol at the Ecophysiology and Animal Physiology lab (Liège University), investigating the effects of temperature and light on the bioenergetics factor of the coral Stylophora pistillata using fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements.

Furthermore, my passion for marine biology has driven me to explore diverse facets of the field. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work in the Biology of Marine Organisms and Biomimetics lab at the University of Mons (Belgium) under the guidance of Dr. Flammang. In this role, I studied the proteins involved in the adhesion of eight different starfish podia. Additionally, I actively participated in the Institute of Marine Biotechnology with Prof. Dr. Ismail at the University of Terengganu (Malaysia), contributing to the identification of marine antifouling compounds derived from resources such as the sponge Stylissa carteri.

I am deeply passionate about marine biology and committed to furthering my career in this field through pursuing a Ph.D. I believe that joining your lab would provide an ideal opportunity for me to contribute to the ongoing research while expanding my knowledge and expertise.

Please let me know if there are any additional documents or information you would like me to provide. I have also attached my CV and transcript.

Thank you very much for considering my inquiry. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Olivier Collard
