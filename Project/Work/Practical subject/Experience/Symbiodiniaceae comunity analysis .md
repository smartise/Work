# Protocol 
- Make dillution of every sample to reach the concentration of approximativly of 20-50 mg/µl
- do a PCR using the diluted sample [[PCR ITS2]]
- repeat the PCR a second time in order to get enough product 
- realize a cleanups with beads [[Cleaning PCR extract]]
- mesure the concentration with Qbit [[Qbit]]
- dilute the sample to get a final concentration 5 mg/µl

# MUST DO TIPS!
## If you have a lot of sample diluted on a PCR plate. 
- when you take off the diluted sample plate off the fridge, let the plate warm for 5 minutes then centrifuge it for 20 second. When warming up, the sample will condence on the aluminium paper. If you don't centrifuge, the droplet on the aluminium will jump in neighbours wells, contaminating the whole plate. 
- When you take off the aluminium paper BE SURE that the plate is on a plate holder. The vibration of the plate will make droplet jump to other wells. 
- To avoid the evaporation of the sample in the thermocycle, crush the cap over the plate with an ependorf holder until you don't ear "ticks" anymore. 
- don't forget to centrifuge the plate after the thermocycler  for the same reason as for the aluminium paper. Don't forget to also take of the caps on a plate holder to avoid vibration. 

## Smaller tips
- if you have a lot of dillution. don't hesitate to write on the  side of the well the dillution you are about to do on each sample. This allow to go faster and not get lost on the dillution. you can also put a line of caps on the last row you finished so you know on which row you are working on. usually the sample has to be diluted either 10 times (0 on the plate), 5 times (5 on the plate), 2 times (2 on the plate), or not (1 on the plate).
