# Methodo 

the corals from the crosstranplantation will be monitored by pictures taken from the smithsonian staff. 
the smithsonian have regular mission to Coiba (4 times a year) and go very often to las perlas. 
since las perlas is where i suspect to have the most bleaching possibilities it will be monitored more. 

the monitoring will only be done by pictures.
