# Reagent 
## first step 
- 3.5 μl Ultra II End-prep Reaction Buffer
- 1.5 μl Ultra II End-prep Enzyme Mix
- 0.5 μl DCS

## second step 
- 12.5 μl Ligation Buffer (LNB)
- 5 μl NEBNext Quick T4 DNA Ligase
- 2.5 μl Ligation Adapter (LA) : DNA adapter for it to enter in the pore

## third after the second cleanup
