# introduction 
do we do rough RNA sequencing to be able to detect AP APA as done by [[yuNanoporeLongreadRNAseq2021]] or cDNA conversion with 


# Database for genefunction
from [[yuNanoporeLongreadRNAseq2021#^edba57]]
1. **NCBI Non-Redundant protein sequences (NR)**
    - Access: [NCBI Protein Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein)
    - Usage: You can search for specific protein sequences, view their annotations, and download datasets.
2. **Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)**
    - Access: [KEGG Database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
    - Usage: KEGG provides information about genomes, biological pathways, diseases, and more. You can search for specific genes or pathways and view their detailed annotations.
3. **euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG)**
    - Access: Part of the [NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd)
    - Usage: You can search for conserved protein domains and view their classifications.
4. **eggNOG**
    - Access: [eggNOG Database](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/)
    - Usage: It provides evolutionary genealogy of genes and allows you to search for orthologous groups and their annotations.
5. **Pfam**
    - Access: [Pfam Database](https://pfam.xfam.org/)
    - Usage: Search for protein families and domains. You can input a protein sequence to find its family or view domain architectures.
6. **Swiss-Prot (part of UniProt)**
    - Access: [UniProt Database](https://www.uniprot.org/)
    - Usage: UniProt is a comprehensive protein sequence and annotation database. Swiss-Prot is the manually annotated and reviewed section of UniProt.
7. **Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COG)**
    - Access: [COG Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/)
    - Usage: It classifies proteins from complete genomes into COGs and provides tools for COG-based comparative analysis.
8. **KOBAS (KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System)**
    - Access: [KOBAS Web Server](http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/)
    - Usage: It's an online tool that annotates an input set of genes with KEGG pathways and provides statistical analysis to identify enriched pathways.
