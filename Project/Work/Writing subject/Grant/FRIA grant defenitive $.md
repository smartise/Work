Corals reef are in a growing state of decline due to the pressure they endure through anthropogenic pressure. their decline does not stop accelerating and with them, the vaste biodiversity they host wich represent a third of the whole ocean Biodiversity. countless effort on the topic has also greatly arise during the last decades through the shape of different initiative such as reef conservation, restauration and sensibilation to population that rely on them. However without a proper understanding on their Biology response to climate change, it is very difficult to have an efficient and clear labor to help those ecosystem as much as we can. Corals are cnidarians that are in obligate symbiosis with dynoflagellate from the genus symbiodinium. This symbiosis is the key to their cological success but is also responsible to their great sensitivity to environmental stressors. the algeae provide over 90% of the energy requirement through photosynthesis to the coral and the coral provide nutrient as well as a protection from the grazer and a stable posisition in the water column to the algeae. However, when exposed to environmental stress, this symbiosis is disturbed and the algea is expeled from the host. This phenomenon is called "coral bleaching" as the coral become white due to the absence of symbiodiniacea within its tissu that give the animals its various colours. All corals are nevertherless, not equally sensible to environmenal stress. some species has devlop different adaptation in order to resist to those stress. among those adaptation, we can count symbiont shuffling (some symbiodiniacea are better at handling stress than other), change in feeding strategies (from autotrophic to heterotrophic and vise versa) or change in gene expression. while the 2 first has been already widely studied, however gene expression and in particular epigenetic mechanism of the host is still in it's beginnings. Epigenetic is the mechanism that structure phenotypic variation via genotype-environment interaction without any genetic mutation. 
Compare to genetic adaptation, epigenetic mechanism is a quick response that can act as a buffer to climate change. moreover those epigenetic adaptation may be transgenerational is some coral's species opening a new scope for coral conservation and restoration in face of climate change. Understanding the dynamics of the epigenetic mechanisms would greatly improve our vision on the fate of corals to climate change. One of the most documented epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation. DNA methylation is the methylation of CpG dinucleotide along the DNA and depending on the quantity of CpG dinucleotide methylated, the gene expression of interest change. One aspect influenced by DNA methylation is the transcriptome. The more a gene-body is methylated, the more reduced the transcriptional variability is. 

The microbiome is also of a great importance to corals response to environmental change. The coral MIcrobiome is constitued of a vast diversity of organism such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and symbiodiniaceae. A great microbiome plasticity is believed to induce a better adaptability to stress. 
Those community tend to also have an impact on epigenetic mechanism on the host and vise versa. 

Panama is a very unique place when it comes to environmental change. The pacific ocean of the contry is divided into 2 mains zone: the golf of chiruiqui and the gulf of panama. Seasonlly, Between December to Mid-april, the gulf of panama undergo un upweelnig phenomenon. This wond-driven upwelling induce a rapid drop of Temperature as well a an increase in nutrient while the golf of chiruiqui is not affected due to orographic blocking. Corals from the species  *pocillopora meandrina* and *Pocillopora verucosa* live in both areas. On the coast of the Coiba Island in the golf of chiruiqui and On the coast of the las perlas islands in the golf of Panama. altough, they are from the same species, the corals from las Perlas has adapted to this constant change of environment. 

The goal of the project is as follow. Observe the difference in gene expression and microbiome from both coral *pocillopora meandrina* and *Pocillopora verucosa* from the 2 zone (Las Perlas and Coiba ) (WP1). Mesure the effect of short term environmental variation (1 year) on the gene expression, the microbiome and the morphology of the corals (WP2). Finaly, determine if this adaptation to environmental variation give them better resislience to heat and cold stress both after a short term environmental variation (1 year) and a long term environmental variation (multiple years). 

This project would give important information concerning the adaptation mechanism to environmental change as well as possible insight of novel ideas to improve coral restoration to better prepare the reef for the increasing climate change 




## Goals of the research 
The futur fate of corals reef has became more and more alarming in those recent years due to the climate change driven increase in sea surface temperature and acidity [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. 
Corals are cnidarians that are in obligate symbiosis with dynoflagellate from the genus Symbiodinium (also known as symbiodiniaceae). The family of symbiodiniaceae is divided within 9 different genera going from A to I wich can also be further divided in different subclade [[cardenas-alvaradoHigherPopulationGenetic2021]],  [[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences]],
[[chenDiversitySymbiodiniaceae152019]]. coral associate with six of them A-D and F and G [[vanoppenBleachingResistanceRole2009]].
This symbiosis is the key of their ecological success. the Symbiodinium provide over 90% of the energy requirement of the corals  and the corals provide the algeae with nutrient and a stable position in the water column [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018]], [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. However this symbiosis has also it's weaknesses and exhibit the organisms to a greater sensitivity to environmental stressors such as climate-change-driven increase in sea surface temperature [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]].
When exposed to such environmental stress, The symbiosis between the two breaks and the symbionts are expelled from the host leading to a phenomenon called "coral bleaching" [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. This mechanism of bleaching has been widely linked to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the endosymbionts and the host itself [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. 
This rapid decline in coral's cover has led to the start of numerous research on corals and on ways to imporve their survival to this rapid change [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. 

``corals as much as plants are sessil organisms and thus can not migrate away from a suboptimal environment. This factor, force the organism to have a strong adaptation capacity to survive to potential change to their environment. [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. some of those adaptation include symbiont shuffling (change in symbiodiniaceae community for more adapted one to the new environment) [[epsteinTemporalVariationMicrobiome2019]], change in regime (from phototrophic to heterotrophic and vice versa) [[meunierBleachingForcesCoral2019]], strong Gene expression plasticity [[dilworthHostGenotypeStable2020]].

Previous study already show that corals that are exposed to a thermal stress tend to be more resilience when subsequent stress occure and the mechanism on which it occures and its dynamic is still broadly unknown [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. 

Here, the goal is to study the dynamic of gene expression and microbiome plasticity of the corals *Pocillopora vercosa* and *Pocillopora meandrina* that have been subject or not to Environmental variation as well as seeing their resilience to subsequent stress. This goal will be met by comparing the (1) DNA methylation of the host , (2) the Gene expression of the host (3) The microbiome associated with the coral and (4) the Energetic store of the coral (total protein, lipid content, carbohydrate content) following different treatment : 
- WP1: Long Environmental change 
- WP2: short Environmental change 
- WP3 : short Temperature stress prior to a long and short environmental change
This project will contribute to a better understanding of the genetical pocessus that induce thermal acclimatation in corals and will have a significative importance on Coral conservation. 
## State of the art 

corals as much as plants are sessil organisms and thus can not migrate away from a suboptimal environment. This factor, force the organism to have a strong adaptation capacity to survive to potential change to their environment. [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. sensibility to environmental stress can depend on multiple carachteristics such as the symbiodiniaceae they host, the microbiomes, the feeding startegie (heterotrophic or autotrophic) but also differential gene expression [[ritson-williamsCoralCommunityResilience2020]]. 

High gene expression plasticity has been shown to be correlated with lower suceptibility to bleaching during environmental stress and that corals that were exposed to Environmental variation tend to be more resilient when expose to subsequent stress[[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016]] [[barshisGenomicBasisCoral2013]]. Epigenetics are the mechanism that structure phenotypic variation [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. 
The flexibility in phenotype may provide a buffer to the change of environment. However, the wash-in wash-out nature of epigenetic makes it hard to predict it's influence into chlimate change response, The magnitude and the duration of those modification are still widely unknown [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]].
 

Epigenetic regulation include different process such has DNA mehtylation, histone modification or non-coding RNA (ncRNA). DNA methylation is one of the most documented epigenetic regulation process and has been linked multiple times with environmental plasticity in corals [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]] [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]].
DNA methylation mostly occures in CpG dinucleotide and is scatter within gene bodies [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. Depending on the methylation of the gene bodies, the expression of it will vary. "house-keeping" gene tend to be more methylated while functions that are dynamically regulated (such as environmentally driven gene) tend to be less methylated [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. 
The high cost of DNA methylation sequencing slow down this tipe of studies, however, with the improvement of nanopore technology, it is now easier to obtain DNA methylation data at a lower coast and with great resolution [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]] [[liuDetectionDNABase2019]].
DNA methylation is a well known mechanism when it comes to plasticity-modulating mechanism [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] and is also known to change due to change in environmental condition [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. 

The transciptome is one of the first line to be influenced by DNA Methylation. Highly methylated gene are displayed reduced transcriptional variability while low methylated gene tend to be expressed more variably [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. corals that are adapted to Environmental variation can also show nativelly upregulated genes linked to temperture tolerence even when incubated in normal condition. Their resilience to stress come from a prevention mechanism rather than a coping mechanism [[barshisGenomicBasisCoral2013]]. To fully understand the response mechanism of resilient corals, the transcriptome has to be considered. 

Corals, however, are not the only one to respond to environmental stress. Beside Symbiodiniaceae, corals also host a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses forming together with the coral, the holobiont. Microbiome dynamic is one of the non genic mechanism allowing corals to adapt to it's environment. For most of the corals, microbiome diversity isn't set and can vary depending on its environment [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020]] and it's plasticity has been shown to have a great impact on the adaptation capacity [[pradaLinkingPhotoacclimationResponses]]. it is also emerging that epigenetic mechanism might be closely influenced by microbiome structure and vice versa  [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]]. Considering the impact of microbiome on the host's epigenetic and it's variation due to environmental change, it's identification has to be measured to hassess its impact on the gene expression.  

Coral morphology is another pattern that is known to vary depending on environmental condition with light, water flow being the most influent one [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a]]. However other environmental change such as temperature and nutrient still poorly understood in term of impact of coral's morphology. Moreover, *Pocillopora meandrina* pocess a morphological sister species, *Pocillopora grandis*. The mecanism that drive this geno


Panama has very unique feature when it comes to ocean environmental change. the Pacific side of panama is divided into 2 main areas, the non-upwelling Gulf of chiriqui and the upwelling Gulf of panama [[dcrozVariabilityUpwellingPacific2007]]. Each year, the gulf of Panama is subject to a seasonal upwelling [[randallUpwellingBuffersClimate2020]]. The upwelling is wind-driven and is influenced by the annual migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and is thus formed by Ekman pumping *(fig )*. Between December to Mid-april the ITCZ migrate south forcing the waters offshore. However in the Golf of Chiriqui the Upwelling has way less effect due to orographic blocking. 
This upwelling induce great change in temperature (by up to 10 °C) and salinity over a short period of time. both reef-building corals from the species *pocillopora meandrina* and *Pocillopora verucosa* lives in Las perlas and Coiba undergoing very distinct Environmental condition.

## Research project 
The project will be conducted on 2 species of corals *Pocillopora meandrina* and *Pocillopora verucosa*. The field experiment will take place at the smithsonian tropical institute (STRI) located in NAOS Panama, with Dr. Mattieu Leray as our colaborator. The Pacific coast of Panama posses an abundant population of pocillopora verucosa as well as pavona clavus in both area, Las Perlas and Coiba. STRI is also equiped with a mesocosm that will be used on wich, pH, temperature, light intensity and salinity can be monitored. 

### WP1 Gene expression of the 2 sites 
This work package will determine the difference in DNA methylation, transcriptome, microbiome and Energetic storage of the Coral *Pocillopora verucose* and *Pocillopora Meandrina* from the 2 sites : Coiba and Las Perlas. For this, 10 colonies from 3 sites in each zones (mogomogo, contadora and saboga for las perlas and granito, canales and machete for Coiba) will be sampled. A triplicate of 3 fragment per colonies will be sampled. The colonies has already been tagged and ready for the sampling period. 
Different parameter will be measured in order to assess the Gene expression plasticity of the coral. For this, the DNA methylation, the Transcriptome (The protocol is described in the additional comment). 

### WP2 transplantation setup 
This workpackage will aim to determine the gene expression plasticity of the corals *Pocillopora verucose* and *Pocillopora Meandrina* from Coiba and Las perlas threw a cross-transplantation between the 2 sites. This package will determine the gene expression dynamics of Environmental change unacllimatize (coming from Coiba) corals exposed to short term environmental change and Environmental change acclimatize corals (Coming from las perlas) exposed to no environmental change. 

The cross-transplantation will consist of 

For this, the DNA methylation, the transcriptome, microbiome will be measured as well as the evolution of the coral's morphology using a 3D modeling device provided by the University of Bruxelles

### WP3 short-stress experiment 
For this Workpackage, corals crosstransplanted between the 2 las perlas and coiba will be subject to a short term stress experiment to observe their resilience to subsequent stress. A year after coral crosstranplantation, corals will be placed in a mesocosm for acclimatation for 30 days at 28°C. After the acclimatation, corals will undergo a cold and hot short term stress of a week. 

For the short-term stress experiment, corals will be first placed at normal temperature (28 °C) and will be gradually change by 1°C each day until reaching the desire stress temperature. For the heat stress, the temperature will be ramped up by 1°C each day for 4 days to reach 32°C. The heat stress will then be maintained for 3 days. For the cold stress, the temperature will be gradually descended by 1 °C each day for 4 days to reach 24°C. the cold stress will be then be maintained for 3 days. 

During the whole experiment, corals will be subject to an average amount of light of 400 PPFD (μmol·m−2·s−1). The temperature and light intensity will also be monitored using underwater logegers (Hobo Watzer temp pro). the corals will be placed in the mesocosm by hanging them using Nilon string. The tank will also be cleaned everyday to avoid any algal proliferation. 

### implication for conservation 
Corals are facing a rapid decline in the recent decades 
Due to the rapid climate change as they are one of the most sensitive animals to environmental change. Their presence is although vital as they are the main builders of coral reefs that host over a third of the ocean biodiversity. 
Currently, genetic adaptation won't be able to keep up with the pace of environmental change. Epigenetic adapatation, however, is a mechanism promoting fast phenotypic plasticity that allow quicker acclimatization capacity. Those adaptation can also persist for decades and might also be transgenerational for some species [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. Understanding the dynamics of those mechanism is of a major importance for enhancing futher coral conservation and 
Pocillopora.sp is also considered the corals of the future of the pacific ocean as they are fast growing, highly adaptable and reef building corals. Understanding their gene expression dynamics would be a key to further devlop their conservation in a fast changing environment. 
# Workplan 
The work plan for the PhD is described in table 1. The structure of the project is manly paced by the upwelling and the non upwelling season as the field work has to occure depending of this phenomenon. The main goal of the project is to write 3 papers. The first paper will focus on the difference in Mehtylation, transcriptome, Microbiome and Energetic store of both species of corals in Las perlas and Coiba. The second paper will be the dynamics of those same factor after a year cross-transplantation and the third will be the dynamics of those factors after a short heat stress following a year environmental change.

# Summary of the master's thesis 

title: Evaluation of the impact of temperature and light on bioenergetics (photosynthesis/respiration) in the coral Stylophora pistillata 

The symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae is a model symbiosis that has been thriving for hundreds of thousands of years. Their association gave birth to the most diverse biotopes, the corals reefs. Each party of the association derives a non-negligible profit from this symbiosis. The Symbiodiniaceae gives a part of the products of their photosynthesis while the host provides nutrient, a stable place in water column and a protection from grazer. This symbiosis is however very fragile and sensitive to external stress. Heat and light stress are the most well-known factors inducing the rupture of the symbiosis as they induce causes a lot of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and is destined to increase with global warming. The rupture of this symbiosis eventually conducts to the loss of the Symbiodinaceae from the coral host, leading to the phenomenon called “bleaching”. This Master’s thesis focuses on the evolution of the bioenergectics of the coral Stylophora pistillata in response to a long heat/light stress. We firstly subjected the coral to a 3-day short heat/light stress to determine the temperature adapted for the realisation of the long stress. We found that both light (darkness and ambient light) and heat (28°C, 30°C, 32°C, 34°C) impacted greatly the bioenergetic of phostosytem II of Stylophora pistillata. The photosynthesis was also significantly reduced when exposed to short heat and light stress. For the long stress, the presence of several flaws in the implementation of the setup prevented the acquisition of conclusive result. The setup being a closed system, the external factor such as climate and lamp heat had a great impact on the stability of the temperature of the setup. Many other problems also occurred apart from the main one. The light stress applied was not homogeneous over the whole beaker.

### Gene expression
The DNA methylation [[liuDetectionDNABase2019]] and Transcriptome [[yuNanoporeLongreadRNAseq2021]] will be measured using Oxford Nanopore technology provided by the University of Bruxelles. This method has shown good accuracy when it comes to methylation measurment [[liuDetectionDNABase2019]]. It is also easier to use and cheaper than the traditional method used for methylation measurment such as Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. 
The hole microbiome will be determined by sequencing the nuclear 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and archea[[waltersImprovedBacterial16S2016]], the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA for the symbiodyniaceae [[arifAssessingSymbiodiniumDiversity2014]] and the 18S rRNA gene for eukaryotes [[devargasEukaryoticPlanktonDiversity2015]]. 
The Symbiodyniaceae community has already been sequenced by myself during the year 2022-2023. 

### Microbiome structure 
Microbiome dynamic is one of the non genic mechanism allowing corals to adapt to it's environment. Microbiome plasticity has also been shown to have a great impact on the adaptation capacity [[pradaLinkingPhotoacclimationResponses]]. 
it is also emerging that epigenetic mechanism might be closely influenced by microbiome structure and vice versa [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]] and Fast Growing corals also tend to have less microbiome plasticity than slow growing corals [[masseBacterialMicrobiotaOstreobium2023]]. To observe if the 

### Energetic store 
the energetic store of the coral will be determinated by the analysis of the total protein, carbohydrate and lipid content. 

### Morphology 
Morphology will be measured using 3D photogrammetry technologie will be used to quantify the growth and the morphological change of colonies. the device will be provided by the university of bruxelles.
