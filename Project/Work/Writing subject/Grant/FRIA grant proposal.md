title : Examining Coral's Resilience: The Impact of Environmental Change on Temperature Stress Response
## Goals of the research 
The futur fate of corals reef has became more and more alarming in those recent years due to the climate change driven increase in sea surface temperature [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. 
Corals are cnidarians that are in obligate symbiosis with dynoflagellate from the genus Symbiodinium (also known as symbiodiniaceae). This symbiosis is the key of their ecological success. the Symbiodinium provide over 90% of the energy requirement of the corals  and the corals provide the algeae with nutrient and a stable position in the water column [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018]], [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. However this symbiosis has also it's weaknesses and exhibit the organisms to a greater sensitivity to environmental stressors such as climate-change-driven increase in sea surface temperature [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]].
When exposed to such environmental stress, The symbiosis between the two breaks and the symbionts are expelled from the host leading to a phenomenon called "coral bleaching" [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. This mechanism of bleaching has been widely linked to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the endosymbionts and the host itself [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. 
This rapid decline in coral's cover has led to the start of numerous research on corals and on ways to imporve their survival to this rapid change [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. 

``corals as much as plants are sessil organisms and thus can not migrate away from a suboptimal environment. This factor, force the organism to have a strong adaptation capacity to survive to potential change to their environment. [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. some of those adaptation include symbiont shuffling (change in symbiodiniaceae community for more adapted one to the new environment) [[epsteinTemporalVariationMicrobiome2019]], change in regime (from phototrophic to heterotrophic and vice versa) [[meunierBleachingForcesCoral2019]], strong Gene expression plasticity [[dilworthHostGenotypeStable2020]].

Previous study already show that corals that are exposed to a thermal stress tend to be more resilience when subsequent stress occure and the mechanism on which it occures and its dynamic is still broadly unknown [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. Here, the goal is to study the Gene expression plasticity of corals that have been subject to Environmental variation an see their resilience to subsequent stress. This goal will be met by comparing the 1) DNA methylation of the host , 2) the Gene expression of the host 3) The microbiome associated with the coral and 4) the Energetic store of the coral (total protein, lipid content, carbohydrate content) on corals that has been exposed to a thermal stress prior to be acllimatized by a environmental variation. This research will be conducted on 2 species of corals,  a rapid growing coral *pocillopora meandrina* and a slow growing coral *pavona clavus*. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the genetical pocessus that induce thermal acclimatation in corals 
and will have a significative importance on Coral conservation. 

## State of the art 

corals as much as plants are sessil organisms and thus can not migrate away from a suboptimal environment. This factor, force the organism to have a strong adaptation capacity to survive to potential change to their environment. [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. sensibility to environmental stress can depend on multiple carachteristics such as the symbiodiniaceae they host, the microbiomes, the feeding startegie (heterotrophic or autotrophic) but also differential gene expression [[ritson-williamsCoralCommunityResilience2020]]. 

Panama has very unique feature when it comes water temperature and salinity. the Pacific side of panama is divided into 2 main areas, the non-upwelling Gulf of chiriqui and the upwelling Gulf of panama [[dcrozVariabilityUpwellingPacific2007]]. Each year, the gulf of Panama is subject to a seasonal upwelling [[randallUpwellingBuffersClimate2020]]. This upwelling induce great change in temperature (by up to 10 °C) and salinity over a short period of time (from december to mid april). both corals from the species *pocillopora meandrina*, *Pocillopora verucosa*,  *pavona clavus* and #qst lives in Las perlas and Coiba undergoing very distinct Environmental stability. 

High gene expression plasticity has been shown to be correlated with lower suceptibility to bleaching during environmental stress and that corals that were exposed to Environmental variation tend to be more resilient when expose to subsequent stress [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016]]. Epigenetics are the mechanism that structure phenotypic variation [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. 
The flexibility in phenotype may provide a buffer to the change of environment. However, the wash-in wash-out nature of epigenetic makes it hard to predict it's influence into chlimate change response, The magnitude and the duration of those modification are still widely unknown [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]].

Epigenetic regulation include different process such has DNA mehtylation, histone modification or non-coding RNA (ncRNA). DNA methylation is one of the most documented epigenetic regulation process and has been linked multiple times with environmental plasticity in corals [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]] [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]].
DNA methylation mostly occures in CpG dinucleotide and is scatter with in gene bodies [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. Depending on the methylation of the gene bodies, the expression of it will vary. "house-keeping" gene tend to be more methylated while functions that are dynamically regulated (such as environmentally driven gene) tend to be less methylated [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. 
The high cost of DNA methylation sequencing slow down this tipe of studies, however, with the improvement of nanopore technology, it is now easier to obtain DNA methylation data at a lower coast and with great resolution [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]] [[liuDetectionDNABase2019]].

The transciptome is one of the first line to be influenced by DNA Methylation. Highly methylated gene are displayed reduced transcriptional variability while low methylated gene tend to be expressed more variably [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. corals that are adapted to Environmental variation can also show nativelly upregulated genes linked to temperture tolerence even when incubated in normal condition. Their resilience to stress come from a prevention mechanism rather than a coping mechanism [[barshisGenomicBasisCoral2013]]. To fully understand the response mechanism of resilient corals, the transcriptome has to be considered. 

Corals, however, are not the only one to respond to environmental stress. Beside Symbiodiniaceae, corals also host a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses forming together with the coral, the holobiont [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020]]. The microbiome can enhance adaptive response of the coral to environmental stress and may have effect on epigenetic mechanisms of the host as well [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]]. #qst 


## Research project 
The project will be conducted on 2 species of corals : on fast growing coral pocillopora meandria, and a slow growing coral pavona clavus. The field experiment will take place at the smithsonian tropical institute (STRI) located in NAOS Panama, with Dr. Mattieu Leray as our colaborator. The Pacific coast of Panama posses an abundant population of pocillopora verucosa as well as pavona clavus in both area, Las Perlas and Coiba. STRI is also equiped with a mesocosm that will be used on wich, pH, temperature, light intensity and salinity can be monitored. 

### WP1 : Experimental setup 
The experimental setup will be set as follow : 
2 differente time scale of Environmental variation (long term and short term) and 2 different acclimatation time post environmental variation (short and lon term) will be set for the short term Environmental variation

For the long term environmental variation, we will use the season upwelling naturally occuring in the golf of panama from january to may. corals from las perlas (Affected by upwelling) and Coiba (Non affected by upwelling) will be collected during the non upwelling season and placed into a mesocosm for acclimatation of 24 days. after the acclimation, a short term temperature (cold and hot) stress of 7 days will be realised. 

For the short term environmental variation. Corals from Coiba (non affected bu upwelling) will be sampled and placed in acclimatation into the mesocosm for 24 days. after that, part of the  corals will be placed at 26°C  for a period of 1 mounth to mimic the upwellig condition at.
![[Upwelling temperature.png]]
the other part will remain in the acclimatation tank to serve as a negative control and prevent false conclusion to the enventual stress that the mesocosm could imply.  Corals from the environmental variation tank will then be placed back in acclimatation at 29°C for 1 week (short term acclimation) and 3 week (Long term acclimation). a short term temperature stress (cold and hot) of 7 days will then be realized after both acclimatation period (short and long term).

For the short-term stress experiment, corals will be first placed at normal temperature (28 °C) and will be gradually change by 1°C each day until reaching the desire stress temperature. For the heat stress, the temperature will be ramped up by 1°C each day for 4 days to reach 32°C. The heat stress will then be maintained for 3 days. For the cold stress, the temperature will be gradually descended by 1 °C each day for 4 days to reach 24°C. the cold stress will be then be maintained for 3 days. 

During the whole experiment, corals will be subject to an average amount of light of 400 PPFD (μmol·m−2·s−1). The temperature and light intensity will also be monitored using underwater logegers (Hobo Watzer temp pro). the corals will be placed in the mesocosm by hanging them using Nilon string. The tank will also be cleaned everyday to avoid any algal proliferation. 

Corals will be collected before the environmental variation (for the short term variation) after the environmental variation, after the acclimatation periode and after the heat stress for measurement. 

To conclude, 3 treatments will be measure. Long term variation with long term acclimatation. short term acclimatation with long term addapation and long term acclimatation with short term addaptation. 

### WP2 : DNA Methylation
DNA methylation is a well known mechanism when it comes to plasticity-modulating mechanism [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] and is also known to change due to change in environmental condition [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. In this WP, methylation will be measured before the environmental change, after the environmental change, before the temperature stress and after the temperature stress. For that, we will use an Oxford Nanopore method. This method has shown good accuracy when it comes to methylation measurment [[liuDetectionDNABase2019]]. It is also easier to use and cheaper than the traditional normally used for methylation measurment such as Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]]. 


### WP3 : Gene expression 
multiple studies have shown that gene expression vary greatly to environmental change [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016]], [[barshisGenomicBasisCoral2013]] and that its plasticity is also the sign of a better resistance to bleaching [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016]]. Here, the gene expression will be measured for the different time scale of enironmental variation. 

### WP 4 : Microbiome structure 
Microbiome dynamic is one of the non genic mechanism allowing corals to adapt to it's environment. Microbiome plasticity has also been shown to have a great impact on the adaptation capacity [[pradaLinkingPhotoacclimationResponses]]. 
it is also emerging that epigenetic mechanism might be closely influenced by microbiome structure and vice versa [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]] and Fast Growing corals also tend to have less microbiome plasticity than slow growing corals [[masseBacterialMicrobiotaOstreobium2023]]. To observe if the 

### WP 5 : Energetic store 
the energetic store of the coral will be determinated by the analysis of the total protein, carbohydrate and lipid content. 


### implication for conservation 
Corals are facing a rapid decline in the recent decades 
Due to the rapid climate change as they are one of the most sensitive animals to environmental change. Their presence is although vital as they are the main builders of coral reefs that host over a third of the ocean biodiversity. 
Currently, genetic adaptation won't be able to keep up with the pace of environmental change. Epigenetic adapatation, however, is a mechanism promoting fast phenotypic plasticity that allow quicker acclimatization capacity. Those adaptation can also persist for decades and might also be transgenerational for some species [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. Understanding the dynamics of those mechanism is of a major importance for enhancing futher coral conservation and 
Pocillopora.sp is also considered the corals of the future of the pacific ocean as they are fast growing, highly adaptable and reef building corals. Understanding their epigenetic dynamics would be a key 


If we can understand how epigenetic changes affect coral health, we may be able to develop new interventions to help corals survive climate change. 


## Workplan 
The work plan for the PhD is described is shown in table 1. The structure of the project is manly paced by the upwelling and the non upwelling season as the field work has to occure depending of this phenomenon. The first paper will focus on adaptation after a long therm environmental variation (multiple years), the second one after short term environmental variation (1 mounth), and the third the difference in gene expression plasticity in slow growing coral and fast growing coral.

## Summary of the master's thesis 

title: Evaluation of the impact of temperature and light on bioenergetics (photosynthesis/respiration) in the coral Stylophora pistillata 

The symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae is a model symbiosis that has been thriving for hundreds of thousands of years. Their association gave birth to the most diverse biotopes, the corals reefs. Each party of the association derives a non-negligible profit from this symbiosis. The Symbiodiniaceae gives a part of the products of their photosynthesis while the host provides nutrient, a stable place in water column and a protection from grazer. This symbiosis is however very fragile and sensitive to external stress. Heat and light stress are the most well-known factors inducing the rupture of the symbiosis as they induce causes a lot of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and is destined to increase with global warming. The rupture of this symbiosis eventually conducts to the loss of the Symbiodinaceae from the coral host, leading to the phenomenon called “bleaching”. This Present study focuses on the evolution of the bioenergectics of the coral Stylophora pistillata in response to a long heat/light stress. We firstly subjected the coral to a 3-day short heat/light stress at 28°C, 30°C, 32°C, 34°C exposed to darkness or normal light. During the different stress we measured the state of activity of the Photosystem 2 (PSII).  We then reitared the experiment for a 7 day stress at 32°C both in light, high light and in complete darkness and measured the response of the PSII, the PSI as well as the pigment content in the sample. 

 found that both light (darkness and ambient light) and heat (28°C, 30°C, 32°C, 34°C) impacted greatly the bioenergetic of phostosytem II of Stylophora pistillata.
