# Main question of the project 
how season and zone affect the epigenetics plasticity of corals 

# Subject proposed 

- how thermocline influence the morphology of corals 
- how microbiome community in corals change between the pacific and atlantic coast of panama 
- size of the genome 
- does the placticity of the morphology of the coral give an advantage to the coral 
- how change the symbiosis of corals between the 2 ismuth 

# reponse 
- on se focalise que sur l'épigénétique et que sur le pacifique 
	- épigéntique avec l'upwelling --> plasticité epigenetique plus importante des coraux qui vive dans las perlas 
	- whole sequence bysulfate sequencing 
	- experience de transplantation entre difference de 
- site methylé selon les different genome 
- selectionner colonie des deux especes 
- plasticité morphologique, croissance des coraux 
- taille du genome en fonction de la profondeur

# QST matt 
- [ ] est ce que pocillopora est présent dans la côte atlantique
-> espèces eteinte dans l'atlantique 
- [ ] quel sont les différence de condition entre la côte pacifique et atlantique 
	- upwelling 
	- courrant 
	- el nino dans le pacifique 

- [ ] serait t'il une bonne idée de faire un test dans simulateur changement de temperature #qst 
- [ ] 
# Extra 

- you hae to explain to positive side of doing this in panama 
	- access to 2 very unique biome (the atlantic coast and the pacific coast)
	- great collaboration possibilities (a lot of people of expertise on a variety of subject)
- pocillopora effusa ? 


# Writing of the application 
## Goals of the research 

- study the differnec epigenetic plasticity as well as the size of the genome of the corals across upwelling season and oceans. 
- Dtermine the gene that are implicated in environmental adaptation (Dark gene) wouls improve the fundamental knowledge of coral gene function 
- Determine if those epigenetic traits are inherited for futur generation 
- 

## State of the art 
## Research project 
- implication for conservation 
If we can understand how epigenetic changes affect coral health, we may be able to develop new interventions to help corals survive climate change.

## Description of the work environment 
I will be supervised by Prof. Jean-François Flot who leads the research team of Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics (EEG) in the Evolutionary Biology and Ecology (EBE) research unit of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). His specialities include species delimitation and phylogenetics, mitogenomics, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics, all of which will be invaluable to the Ph.D. project. The laboratory equipment available to the EEG research team includes a sterile UV cabinet for DNA manipulation, a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and a Qubit fluorometer. Several PCR machines are available as well as gel eletrophoresis equipment contained in a dedicated post-PCR workspace. The laboratory includes a 48-capillary ABI sequencer. Illumina machines are available at the ULB-VUB BrightCore. I will have access to the "Consortium des Équipements de Calcul Intensif" for analyses requiring high computational power. Ultimatly, This PhD will be done under the co-supervision of Dr. Matthieu Leray. He is the leader of the Leray Lab in the Smithsonian tropical research institute (STRI) in Panama and suppervised my year internship at STRI during the year 2022-2023. His expertise are, Genomics, Coral Reef Ecology, Genotyping, which will be of a major help for the realisation of this PhD. The institution also pocess numerous facilities along both coast of panama which will significantly help for the sampling, an environmental simulation coral setup, a molecular genetic laboratory with several PCR machine, gel electrophoresis equipment, a sterile UV cabinet for DNA manipulation, a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and a qubit fluorometer. An illumina machine is also available

## Summary of the master's thesis 

title: Evaluation of the impact of temperature and light on bioenergetics (photosynthesis/respiration) in the coral Stylophora pistillata 

The symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae is a model symbiosis that has been thriving for hundreds of thousands of years. Their association gave birth to the most diverse biotopes, the corals reefs. Each party of the association derives a non-negligible profit from this symbiosis. The Symbiodiniaceae gives a part of the products of their photosynthesis while the host provides nutrient, a stable place in water column and a protection from grazer. This symbiosis is however very fragile and sensitive to external stress. Heat and light stress are the most well-known factors inducing the rupture of the symbiosis as they induce causes a lot of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and is destined to increase with global warming. The rupture of this symbiosis eventually conducts to the loss of the Symbiodinaceae from the coral host, leading to the phenomenon called “bleaching”. This Present study focuses on the evolution of the bioenergectics of the coral Stylophora pistillata in response to a long heat/light stress. We firstly subjected the coral to a 3-day short heat/light stress at 28°C, 30°C, 32°C, 34°C exposed to darkness or normal light. During the different stress we measured the state of activity of the Photosystem 2 (PSII).  We then reitared the experiment for a 7 day stress at 32°C both in light, high light and in complete darkness and measured the response of the PSII, the PSI as well as the pigment content in the sample. 

 found that both light (darkness and ambient light) and heat (28°C, 30°C, 32°C, 34°C) impacted greatly the bioenergetic of phostosytem II of Stylophora pistillata.
