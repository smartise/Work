# Title 
the effect of exogenous antioxidant on the coral A.cervicornis 

# Abstract 

Coral reefs are at the forefront of concern for persistence in the Anthropocene. Their decline affects not only biodiversity but also millions of human livelihoods. Their maintenance in the face of environmental change is increasingly urgent. Natural recovery has been widely demonstrated to be insufficient, and multiple interventions must be put in place to limit their decline (e.g., restoration efforts). Enriched food with antioxidants is able to counteract damaging effects caused by free radicals on human health. Those free radicals are also known to play a significant role in the process of coral bleaching, which involves the breakdown of the symbiosis between the coral and their photosynthetic endosymbionts, upon which they greatly rely. In this context, the present project aims to test if food enriched with antioxidants can benefit the resistance of reef-building corals to environmental stressors (e.g., ocean warming) and contribute to the success of restoration efforts. To test this hypothesis, fragments from one endangered species (Acropora cervicornis) will be submitted to different feeding treatments, including enriched food with antioxidants, in a coral nursery developed for restoration efforts in the Caribbean, Panama. After the feeding trials are complete, corals will be tested for thermal stress resistance (different scenarios of ocean warming will be tested in a controlled experiment) or outplanted into their natural environment for subsequent monitoring of their health and survivorship. Traits such as linear growth, photosynthetic efficiency, capacity to fight against free radicals, and bleaching descriptors will be measured to determine their resistance and health. 

This project will not only shed light on the impact of antioxidants on corals but will also be the start of a novel way to enhance coral conservation in Panama and in many other places in the world

# Introduction Theorique

Coral reef are amoung the most biodiverse biotope in the world. they only represent 1% of the marine environment but host over a third of the known marine species [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]] [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]]. their ecological services are countless. they prevent coastal erosion, are an important source of food for populations that rely on them and support life stages of many marine species [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]] [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]]. However, due to the anthropogenic activities, those ecosystem are in serious decline. [[dietzelPopulationSizesGlobal2021]], [[brunoRegionalDeclineCoral2007]]. This phenomenon has been linked to a variety of factors such as desstructive fishing method, declining water quality, coral predators or disease outbreaks [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]] [[vanoppenShiftingParadigmsRestoration2017]]. Nevertheless, since the last decades, corals faces a much more global threat, Climate change [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. 

Corals are symbiotic Cnidarians that are in obligate symbioses with photosynthetic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]]. This relationship is strongly beneficial for both partners and is the key to the success of coral reefs. [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. However this symbiosis has also it's weaknesses and exhibit the organisms to a greater sensitivity to environmental stressors such as climate-change-driven increase in sea surface temperature [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. When exposed to such environmental stress, The symbiosis between the two breaks and the symbionts are expelled from the host leading to a phenomenon called "coral bleaching" [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. This mechanism of bleaching has been widely linked to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the endosymbionts and the host itself [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. To prevent that, the Host an the symbiont use a set of antioxidant enzyme to scavenge the exess of ROS [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]] [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. however when the stress is too great or last for an extended period of time, the production of ROS exceed the detoxidfication rate [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. 
Those ROS then causes multiple cellular damage that can be lethal to the organism giving no other choice to the host than breaking the symbiosis. The coral becomes white (bleached) and severly weakened [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. 

# Exogenous Antioxydant 

Despite the fact that corals are mostly autotrophic animals [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018]], they can also rely on their heterotrophic feeding when the condition are not favorable such as low-light environments [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. This heterotrophic feeding has shown great result when it comes to coral restoration [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]]. heterotrophic feeding with zooplankton such as Artemia salina nauplii greatly accelerate the growth of coral fragment, reduce the cost of coral nursery as it reduce the time and the effort necessary for the fragment to reach the minimum size for transplantation and also help them overcome the early and most fragile post-settlment stages more rapidly.  interestingly, the beneficial effect of this feeding perpetuate even after the transplantation [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]], [[petersenInfluenceDifferentFood2008]]. 

As much as for human, this food can be enhanced with a varitety of supplement to push even futher the beneficial aspect of it's consumption [[varzakasInnovativeFortifiedFood2018]].
Different components can be used to enrich food to supplement endogenous levels in human body such as probiotics, lipids, and antioxydants [[varzakasInnovativeFortifiedFood2018]].
Antioxidant in particular, are molecules that protect a biologial target against oxidative damage caused by free radical (e.g., reactive oxygen species). Many of those antioxidant are composed of essentials metals that are acquired through heterotrophic feeding and accumulated in the symbiont and help avoid thermal stress damage and subsequent bleaching [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. 
Antioxidant such as catechin, ascorbate and catalase, dissolved in seawater has shown a strong effect on reducing the ROS level in corals during thermal stress, preventing them from bleaching  [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. Additionally, essential metals involved in the composition of antioxidant enzymes â€“ that are acquired primarily through heterotrophic feeding are accumulated in the symbionts and help avoid thermal stress damage and subsequent bleaching [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. 


# The aim of the project 

When it comes to the Caribbean sea, the genus Acropora is the main reef-building taxon [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. They are fast growing, branching species that are particullary vulnerable to thermal stress, sotrms and disease [[millerSpatialDistributionMicrobial2020]], [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. The majority of coral loss in the caribbean sea is actually due to the decline of the genus acropora in the sea. both species (acropora cervicornis and acropora palmata) are now listed as critically endangered on the internation Union of Conservation of nature (UCN) [[kuffnerReestablishingSteppingstonePopulation2020]]. Since they have an great ecological value and one of the most studied species, this project will focus on those 2 species. 

My aim is as follow: test the effect of the enhanced food (zooplankton enriched in antioxidants and essential metals) on the redox balance of the species A.cervicornis during a heat stress. test the beneficial effect of enhanced food on the survival of transplanted corals back into the reef.

# methodology
## sampling
#modif
the experiment will be set up in the coral nursery of the reef2reef foundation located near playa huerta, puertobello, Panama. Corals fragments of 5 cm length will be collected by the reef2reef team from one endangered species (A.cervicornis). 6 different colony of each will be sampled. Each colony and fragment will be tagged to be able to find back the mother colony. for each colony, 12 fragments will be sampled for a total of 72 fragments for the entire experiment. 

## setup
#modif
The fragment will then be placed in line nursery according to the digram shown in figure 1 the setup consist of a square of 2m side made of 4 metal bar suspended 1m above the substrate. the line holding the setup to the substrate will be held by 4 ground anchors and float using 4 15cm diameter buoys 2 m above the suspended fragments.
Each fragment will be spaced by 15 cm from each other to avoid colony branch abrasion. 
![[54G83TI82.png]]
modified image retrieved from Georgen et al. representing the setup that will be used in situ [[goergenGenotypeAttachmentTechnique2018]].
This method is the most effective method in therm of nursery, as it allow the fastest growth rate, low predation, maintenance, and predation [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. This setup has also already been use at the central Caribbean Marine Institue, CCMI in a preliminary experiment conducted at the A.cervicornis nursery. 

The colonies will be separated into 3 experimental group, "Control", "Fed" and "super-fed". The colonies from the "Control" group will only be fed by the food naturally available, The ones from the "Fed" group will be supplied with Artemia salina nauplii, and The "superfed" treatment will be supplied with A.salina nauplii enriched in antioxidants and essentials metals. Each experimental group will be placed on a different frame (setup) for a total of 3 frames. The frames will then have 24 fragment each. 

## food enrichment

for the "superfed" treatment, a batch of Artemia salina nauplii will be enriched with water-saluble antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C), and essential metals (e.g., Zinc). The Brine chrimp, Artemia salina nauplii, will be used as the biocarrier. A. salina nauplii can be stored for a long periods, is commercially available at low costs, and can be easily enriched with different nutrient to meet specific requirements of many organisms, including corals [[hiiFeedingScleractinianCoral2009]]. Methods of enrichment will follow preliminary tests well-established aquaculture techniques and supplement concentration enrichment will follow preliminary test performed by Marangoni et al. in Acropora cervicornis. 
The data being unpublished, the details can not be share in this application. although corals shows a positive feedback when greatly fed [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]], an excess of antioxydant can also trigger a loss of symbiont if no stress is present [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. The doses must therefore be accurate to obtain the best result. 

## In situ feeding 
#modif

~2000 nauplii contained in a syringe will be offered to each coral. For that, Ziploc bags (sandwich size) will be placed around the coral and closed. The right amount of food will then be injected inside the bag. Coral will be left to feed for around 1 h, afterward, the Ziploc bags will be removed and reused for the next feeding event. Feeding will be performed three times a week for 6 weeks. 

## Outplanting of experimental corals 

after 6-week period, 2 fragment from each treatment and for each colony (36 fragments), will be outplanted to natural reefs near Playa Huerta, Colon, Portobelo, along permanent transects previously set up by the Reef2reef team. For this, the fragment will be attached to a cement puck to be next, wedged into a hole using epoxy resin. The outplanting fragment will be monitored by the reef2reef team over 12 mounths. Over a short period of 3 mounth, few event (e.g. storm, heat stress, pollution) is suspected to happen and may lead to unrealistic conclusion. Many short term restoration studies inflate their survival rate by providing only short monitoring leading to false sucess [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]]. This long-term monitorig is therefore necessary to study the long therm survival of superfed corals and will be funded by their own grant. 

# In water monitoring 

During the nursering period and after the outplanting, the linear growth (LG), the survival rate (SR) and the photosynthetic efficiency (PE) of each fragment will be measured.
the LG will be recorded using a calipers. Given the short period of time, this method is the easiest and the most reliable, considering the fragments won't have the time to produce more branches. 
the SR will be measured by estimating the live tissue remaining on the fragment (% live tissue remaining).
The PE is measured using a non-destructive method of pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry [Diving PAM, Walz]. 

## Thermal stress laboratory experiment
#modif
After the 6-week feeding period in the nursery, 6 fragment for each treatment and each colony will be exposed to a one-week short-term thermal stress to assess their resistance reponse. Fragments will be collected and transported in water tanks with aeration to Naos laboratories, Panama City, where a contralled experiment will be conducted. For that, the corals will be placed in a cooler with fresh sea water oxygenated using an oxygenation system and cover from sunlight. 

The setup of the termal stress is shown in figure 2. It will consist of 2 tables containing 3 aquariums each: one table will remain at 27-28Â°C temperature (control) and the other will be submitted to a heat stress. 

For the thermal stress, 18 fragments (3 from each colonie) separated in 3 aquarium will be left at 27-28Â°C for an acclimatation of 1 days. Seawater temperature will then be ramped up by 1Â°C every day for 4 days to reach 32Â°C. The heat-stress will then be maintained for 3 days. 
For the control, 18 fragments (3 from each colonie) separated in 3 aquarium will be left at 27-28Â°C for the whole experiment (7 days). 

![[Pasted image 20230602131234.png]]

Fragments used in the thermal stress experiment will be immediatly flash frozen at -80Â°C at the end of the experiment for laboratory analysis at Naos Laboratories to access their redox balance (antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation), biomass (protein quantification), bleaching descriptors (symbiont and chlorophyll contents). Those physiological and biochemical trait will be measured following well established protocols from Marangoni et al. 2019, 2020, 2021 [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[fernandesdebarrosmarangoniUnravellingDifferentCauses2020]], 

## Feasibility, significance and expected result. 

The present project can be successfully conducted in Panama because of the support of the advisory team, available facilities (Naos laboratories and reef2reef coral nursery), and the connection built with reef2reef foundation team (see letter of support). This project could bring knowledge on multiple aspect of coral biology: a better understanding of the effect of exogenous antioxidant and metals on coral redox balance and on coral bleaching, the potential discovery of a new low-cost way to enhance coral restoration, and th initiation of a new restoration project in the caribbean sea. 

Considering the short therm of the project here, the main goal of the project will be to study the effect of antioxydant enhanced food on their survivability right after the tranplantation and after a short termal stress. The long term monitoring will be realized by the Reef2reef team with their own financial power.

because the proposed methodology requires low-cost material and simple procedures for its execution (construction of frame and procedures to prepare and store food), this approach will be appliable by coral reef restoration worldwide. This program would also greatly strenghten the relation between STRI and reef2reef. Strong relation between restoration practitioners and scientist is a key to the sucessfull devlopment of coral conservation knowledge. 

## Personal interest 

As a graduated master's student in oceanography, I have developed a strong interest in coral conservation, finding myself drawn to the captivating world of these remarkable creatures. The beauty and significance of coral reefs have truly captured my imagination, inspiring a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to contribute to their preservation. The colorful reefs and intricate ecosystems they house are not only visually stunning but also crucial for the well-being of our oceans. With great enthusiasm, I am keen to be part of a coral conservation program, actively working to understand the challenges they face, such as climate change and human impact. By joining this program, I hope to play a role in raising awareness about the importance of coral reefs and ensuring their protection for future generations to appreciate and cherish.

# Conservation

Considering the paramount importance of corals and their rapid decline, the last decades have witnessed an exponential increase of coral reef restoration initiatives, many of wich are based on sexual and asexual coral propagation or substratum enhancement methods [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]]. However, due to the rapid environmental change the world is facing, The community came to the realization that propagation alone was not sufficient for the long-term survival of outplanted coral. Corals need to be equipped with enhanced resilience to stress [[suggettCoralBleachingPatterns2020a]]. This has led to the devlopment of numerous innovative practices to integrate coral resilience into coral reef restoration (e.g. maniuplation of symbiotic partnerships within coral holobiont) [[vanoppenShiftingParadigmsRestoration2017]]. However those methods needs expensive ressources that can't be applied at a large scale and restoration practitioners still lack cost-effective methods to strengthen outplanted corals [[vanoppenShiftingParadigmsRestoration2017]].

## other result


Our project on coral reef restoration will actively promote diversity in multiple ways. firstly, The project will be realized in association with the Reef2reef team. Reef2reef is a panamean NGO that work on reef conservation in the caribbean coast of Panama (Puertobello). By actively engaging with the NGO, we will develop initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, working toward a society where everyone feels valued and empowered.



secondly, (chat gpt, find an argument in what a restoration project in panama could bring more diversity into the world of science)



lastly, i will strive to create educational and outreach content about my project to reach diverse audiences such as schools, marginalized communities, community organizations or more broadly community outside the scientific world. As i spent time here in Panama outside of the STRI circle and mix with other community, i realized that a great majority of the people are actually unaware of the state of the reef as well as some do not know what a coral is. 


# Critics first round

Is the topic innovative or original? The proposed research is an innovative approach to coral reef restoration efforts. While the application of in situ enhanced coral feeding has been explored with success in other regions of the world, more information about its efficacy and applicability in different settings and corals species is needed. In the Panamanian Caribbean, as in many other regions of the world, Acroporids are fragile reef building coral in need of innovative methods of restoration. Is the proposed work well-defined? There are some areas of the proposed project that need further information to assess its suitability or that need refinement. For example, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">heterotrophic feeding has been shown to help recovery of corals after heat stress, but the proposed heat stress experiment is planned to be conducted after the in -situ feeding experiment. A reference showing the benefit of heterotrophy before thermal stress would have help validate the method proposed.</mark> In addition, the methodology of the thermal stress experiment lacks important details. For example, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">what are the controls of the experiment? How is the heat stress going to be conducted? </mark>I know. but other reviewers won't know the details.<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> What will be the significance of the completed study to its field</mark>? Coral reef nursery for restoration are common worldwide, however, the scientific rigorous to test its efficacy and replicability is often overseen. A partnership with an NGO such as Reef2Reef would greatly benefit their ongoing efforts. Is the methodology of the proposed work adequate and appropriate? Lacks some important details. For example, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sample sizes for the in situ feeding experiment are not provided, therefore, its difficult to assess its feasibility.</mark> A simple graph showing experimental details would have helped, instead of showing many pictures of an experiment conducted elsewhere. Monitoring of out-planted corals is to be conducted for 12 months, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in the timeline no details about the team and/or financing to conduct such monitoring is proposed.</mark> This leaves an open-ended question about its feasibility, there will be time and money to be invested,

## introduction 
Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse biotopes in the world. They represent only 1% of the marine environment but host over a third of the known marine species [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]] [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]]. Their ecological services are countless, as they prevent coastal erosion, provide an important food source for populations, and support the life stages of many marine species [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]] [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]]. However, anthropogenic activities have led to a serious decline in these ecosystems [[dietzelPopulationSizesGlobal2021]], [[brunoRegionalDeclineCoral2007]]. This decline has been linked to various factors such as destructive fishing methods, declining water quality, coral predators, and disease outbreaks [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]] [[vanoppenShiftingParadigmsRestoration2017]]. In recent decades, corals have faced an even greater global threat: climate change [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020a]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]].

Corals are symbiotic cnidarians that have an obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]]. This symbiotic relationship is crucial for the success of coral reefs [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. However, this symbiosis also makes the organisms more sensitive to environmental stressors such as an increase in sea surface temperature driven by climate change [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]], [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]]. When exposed to such stress, the symbiosis breaks down, and the symbionts are expelled from the host, resulting in a phenomenon known as "coral bleaching" [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. This bleaching process is often caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the endosymbionts and the host itself [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. To prevent bleaching, the host and symbiont utilize a set of antioxidant enzymes to scavenge the excess ROS [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. However, under severe or prolonged stress, the production of ROS exceeds the detoxification rate [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]], leading to multiple cellular damages that can be lethal to the organism, forcing the host to break the symbiosis and become severely weakened [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]].

## Exogenous Antioxydant 

Despite the fact that corals are mostly autotrophic animals [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018]], they can also rely on their heterotrophic feeding when the conditions are not favorable, such as low-light environments [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]]. This heterotrophic feeding has shown great results when it comes to coral restoration [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]]. Heterotrophic feeding with zooplankton, such as Artemia salina nauplii, greatly accelerates the growth of coral fragments, reduces the cost of coral nurseries by reducing the time and effort necessary for the fragments to reach the minimum size for transplantation, and also helps them overcome the early and most fragile post-settlement stages more rapidly. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of this feeding perpetuate even after the transplantation [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]], [[petersenInfluenceDifferentFood2008]].

Just like for humans, this food can be enhanced with a variety of supplements to further enhance its beneficial aspects of consumption [[varzakasInnovativeFortifiedFood2018]]. Different components can be used to enrich food and supplement endogenous levels in the human body, such as probiotics, lipids, and antioxidants [[varzakasInnovativeFortifiedFood2018]]. Antioxidants, in particular, are molecules that protect a biological target against oxidative damage caused by free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species). Many of these antioxidants are composed of essential metals that are acquired through heterotrophic feeding and accumulated in the symbionts, helping to avoid thermal stress damage and subsequent bleaching [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]].

Antioxidants such as catechin, ascorbate, and catalase, when dissolved in seawater, have shown a strong effect on reducing the ROS (reactive oxygen species) level in corals during thermal stress, preventing them from bleaching [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. Additionally, essential metals involved in the composition of antioxidant enzymes, which are primarily acquired through heterotrophic feeding, are accumulated in the symbionts and help avoid thermal stress damage and subsequent bleaching [[ferrier-pagesCoralBleachingLinked2018]].

## The aim of the project 

When it comes to the Caribbean Sea, the genus Acropora is the main reef-building taxon [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. They are fast-growing, branching species that are particularly vulnerable to thermal stress, storms, and disease [[millerSpatialDistributionMicrobial2020]], [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. The majority of coral loss in the Caribbean Sea is actually due to the decline of the genus Acropora. Both species (Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata) are now listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [[kuffnerReestablishingSteppingstonePopulation2020]]. Since they have great ecological value and are among the most studied species, this project will focus on those two species.

My aim is as follows: to test the effect of enhanced food (zooplankton enriched in antioxidants and essential metals) on the redox balance of the species A. cervicornis during a heat stress and to test the beneficial effect of enhanced food on the survival of transplanted corals back into the reef.

## Methodology 
### sampling 

The experiment will be set up in the coral nursery of the Reef2Reef Foundation, located near Playa Huerta, Portobelo, Panama. Coral fragments measuring 5 cm in length will be collected by the Reef2Reef team from the endangered species A. cervicornis. Six different colonies of A. cervicornis will be sampled. Each colony and fragment will be tagged to facilitate the identification of the mother colony. For each colony, 12 fragments will be sampled, resulting in a total of 72 fragments for the entire experiment.

### Setup

The fragment will then be placed in the line nursery according to the diagram shown in Figure 1. The setup consists of a square with a side length of 2m, made of 4 metal bars suspended 1m above the substrate. The line holding the setup to the substrate will be secured by 4 ground anchors and will float using 4 buoys with a diameter of 15cm, positioned 2m above the suspended fragments.

Each fragment will be spaced 15cm apart from each other to avoid branch abrasion between colonies.

![[54G83TI82.png]] Modified image retrieved from Georgen et al., representing the setup that will be used in situ [[goergenGenotypeAttachmentTechnique2018]].

This method is the most effective approach in terms of nursery techniques, as it allows for the fastest growth rate, low predation, and easy maintenance [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]]. This setup has also been previously used at the Central Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI) in a preliminary experiment conducted at the A.cervicornis nursery.

The colonies will be separated into 3 experimental groups: "Control," "Fed," and "super-fed." The colonies from the "Control" group will only be fed with the naturally available food. The ones from the "Fed" group will be supplied with Artemia salina nauplii, and the "superfed" treatment will be supplied with A.salina nauplii enriched in antioxidants and essential metals. Each experimental group will be placed on a different frame (setup), resulting in a total of 3 frames. Each frame will contain 24 fragments.

### food enrichment 

For the "Super-fed" treatment, a batch of Artemia salina nauplii will be enriched with water-soluble antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C) and essential metals (e.g., zinc). The brine shrimp, Artemia salina nauplii, will be used as the biocarrier. A. salina nauplii can be stored for long periods, is commercially available at low cost, and can be easily enriched with different nutrients to meet the specific requirements of many organisms, including corals [[hiiFeedingScleractinianCoral2009]].

The methods of enrichment will follow preliminary tests using well-established aquaculture techniques, and the concentration of the supplements will be determined based on preliminary tests performed by Marangoni et al. in Acropora cervicornis. Since the data is unpublished, the details cannot be shared in this application. Although corals show a positive response when fed abundantly [[tohAugmentingPostTransplantationGrowth2014a]], an excess of antioxidants can also trigger a loss of symbionts if no stress is present [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. Therefore, the doses must be accurate to achieve the best results.

### In situ feeding 
  
Approximately 2000 nauplii contained in a syringe will be offered to each coral. For this purpose, Ziploc bags (sandwich size) will be placed around the coral and securely closed. The appropriate amount of food will then be injected inside the bag. The corals will be allowed to feed for approximately 1 hour. Subsequently, the Ziploc bags will be carefully removed and reused for the next feeding event. Feeding will be performed three times a week for a duration of 6 weeks.

### Outplanting of experimental corals 

After the 6-week period, three fragments from each treatment and for each colony will be outplanted to natural reefs near Playa Huerta, Colon, Portobelo, along permanent transects that were previously set up by the Reef2reef team. To facilitate the outplanting process, the fragments will be attached to cement pucks and wedged into holes using epoxy resin. The outplanted fragments will be monitored by the Reef2reef team for a duration of 12 months. During the initial 3-month period, various events such as storms, heat stress, and pollution are expected to occur, which could lead to unrealistic conclusions if only short-term monitoring is conducted. Many short-term restoration studies inflate their survival rates by providing only brief monitoring, resulting in false success [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020]]. Therefore, this long-term monitoring is necessary to study the long-term survival of superfed corals and will be funded by a separate grant.

### In water monitoring 

During the nursing period and after the outplanting, several parameters will be measured, including linear growth (LG), survival rate (SR), and photosynthetic efficiency (PE) of each fragment.

The linear growth (LG) will be measured using calipers. Given the short duration of the study, this method is the easiest and most reliable since the fragments will not have sufficient time to produce additional branches.

The survival rate (SR) will be determined by estimating the percentage of live tissue remaining on the fragment.

Photosynthetic efficiency (PE) will be measured using a non-destructive method called pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry [Diving PAM, Walz]

### Thermal stress laboratory experiment 

After the 6-week feeding period in the nursery, six fragments for each treatment and each colony will be exposed to a one-week short-term thermal stress to assess their resistance response. Fragments will be collected and transported in water tanks with aeration to Naos Laboratories in Panama City, where a controlled experiment will be conducted. For this purpose, the corals will be placed in a cooler with fresh seawater, oxygenated using an oxygenation system, and protected from sunlight.

The setup of the thermal stress is depicted in Figure 2. It will consist of two tables, each containing three aquariums: one table will remain at a temperature of 27-28Â°C (control), while the other will be subjected to heat stress.

For the thermal stress, 18 fragments (three from each colony) separated into three aquariums will be acclimated at 27-28Â°C for one day. The seawater temperature will then be gradually increased by 1Â°C per day for four days until reaching 32Â°C. The heat stress will then be maintained for three days. For the control group, 18 fragments (three from each colony) separated into three aquariums will be kept at 27-28Â°C throughout the entire seven-day experiment.

Fragments used in the thermal stress experiment will be immediately flash-frozen at -80Â°C at the end of the experiment for laboratory analysis at Naos Laboratories. This analysis will assess their redox balance (antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation), biomass (protein quantification), and bleaching descriptors (symbiont and chlorophyll contents). These physiological and biochemical traits will be measured following well-established protocols from Marangoni et al., 2019, 2020, 2021 [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], [[fernandesdebarrosmarangoniUnravellingDifferentCauses2020]].

### Feasibility, significance and expected result 

The present project can be successfully conducted in Panama due to the support of the advisory team, the availability of facilities (Naos Laboratories and Reef2Reef coral nursery), and the connection established with the Reef2Reef Foundation team (see letter of support). This project has the potential to contribute to various aspects of coral biology, including gaining a better understanding of the effects of exogenous antioxidants and metals on coral redox balance and bleaching, discovering a new low-cost method to enhance coral restoration, and initiating a new restoration project in the Caribbean Sea.

Given the project's short duration, the main goal will be to study the effect of antioxidant-enhanced food on coral survivability immediately after transplantation and following a short-term thermal stress. The long-term monitoring will be carried out by the Reef2Reef team with their own financial resources.

Since the proposed methodology requires low-cost materials and simple procedures for execution (such as the construction of frames and food preparation/storage procedures), this approach can be applied to coral reef restoration efforts worldwide. Moreover, this program would significantly strengthen the relationship between STRI and Reef2Reef. A strong partnership between restoration practitioners and scientists is crucial for the successful development of coral conservation knowledge.

### Personal Interest 

As a graduated master's student in oceanography, I have developed a strong interest in coral conservation, finding myself drawn to the captivating world of these remarkable creatures. The beauty and significance of coral reefs have truly captured my imagination, inspiring a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to contribute to their preservation. The colorful reefs and intricate ecosystems they house are not only visually stunning but also crucial for the well-being of our oceans. With great enthusiasm, I am keen to be part of a coral conservation program, actively working to understand the challenges they face, such as climate change and human impact. By joining this program, I hope to play a role in raising awareness about the importance of coral reefs and ensuring their protection for future generations to appreciate and cherish.

# Abstract

Coral reefs are at the forefront of concern for persistence in the Anthropocene. Their decline affects not only the biodiversity but also millions of human livelihoods. Their maintenance in the face of environmental change is increasingly urgent. Natural recovery has been widely demonstrated to be insufficient and multiple interventions must be put in place to limit their decline (e.g. restoration efforts). Enriched food in antioxidants are able to counteract damaging effects caused by free radicals in human health. Those free radicals are also known to take huge part in the process of coral bleaching - the breakdown of the symbiosis between the coral and their photosynthetic endosymbionts on which they greatly rely on. In this context, the present project aims to test if food enriched with antioxidants can benefit reef-building corals resistance to environmental stressors (e.g. ocean warming) and to contribute to the success of restoration efforts. To test this hypothesis, fragments from one endangered species (Acropora cervicornis), will be submitted to different feeding treatments (including enriched food with antioxidants) in a coral nursery developed for restoration efforts in the Caribbean, Panama. After the feeding trials are complete, corals will be tested for thermal stress resistance (different scenarios of ocean warming will be tested in a controlled experiment), or replanted into their natural environment for subsequent monitoring of their health and survivorship. Traits such as linear growth, photosynthetic efficiency, capacity to fight against free radicals, and bleaching descriptors will be measured to determine their resistance and health.
