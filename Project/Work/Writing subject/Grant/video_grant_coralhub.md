- Food supplement^ is a billions dollars market that have been fastly growing for decades. 
- Wether is it to achieve your summer body or to give a shiny and soft fur to your pet.,^ food supplement have shown their beneficial effect threw a vast list of studies (20s)

- My name is Oliver Collard and i am an Intern at the Smithsonian Tropical institute in Panama 
- and today i will present you my futur project^ that invovle the use of supperfood to improve coral restoration efforts in the carribean reefs. (15s)

- This project will be carried out with the help of the foundation reef2reef.
- Reef2reef is a NGO created in 2018 that carry restoration and conservation of corals on the caribbean coast of Panama (45s). 

(put a song here)
- As probably most of you already know, The phenomenon of cloral Bleaching has been widely linked to the production of reactive oxygene species that damage the animal's cells.
- As much as for humans, the effect of those species can be conteract using antioxydant 
- 

- The idea that came up then to our mind was then: 
- could giving enriched food in antioxidant^ conteract this phenomenon to better prepare the coral before the transplantation in the open sea (15s). 

- to answear this question Two endangered coral species from the antlantic coast will be collected (acropora cervicornis and A.palmata). 

cervicornis

palmata

- The fragments collected will then be placed in the NGO nursery in 3 groups 
- One group that will be unfed 
- One group that will be fed with Artemia 
- One group that will be fed with Artemia enriched with antioxydant.

- Following the feeding incubation, the resistance of coral fragment from the 3 different conditions will be tested. 
- For that, we will realise a short thermal stress experiment using the STRI Aquarium Facilities.
- As well as transplanting other fragments into the Caribean sea

- In parallele, the physiological and biochemical parameters of those fragments will be monitored and analyzed^ to follow their evolution in those 2 differents experiment.

- The complications of this project will come with the location of the Nursery and the STRI facilities. 
- The Nursery is located in the caribbean coast of panama while the STRI lab are located in the Pacific side next to panamacity. 
- The sample will then have to be transported from one side to another^ and that's where the Coral Research Hub grant will come into use.
