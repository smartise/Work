## note 
- since i know that the coral in mogo mogohas a different morphology i also wonder if transplanting them back in a low flow zone will reverse the morphology 
- it will be interesting to know if the gene that are used for cold stress are the same for heat stress and so if the coral that are used to cold stress are also used for heat stress 
- why couldn't we use pcr with bisulfite and nanopore to be able to use smaller amount of sample #qst

## Slide titre
Hello everyone, 
My name is Olivier Collard i am a graduated master student in oceanography from the university of liège and <p align="left">i will present you mon project as PhD candidate for the FRIA. <<p align="justify"></p>/p>

My project is called, Examining Coral Resilience in the Field and Laboratory: Impacts of Previous Environmental Changes on Temperature Stress Responses.

This project will happen trough the association of the smithsonian tropical research institute in Panama and the university of brussels. 
## Introduction biology coral 
- They are symbiotic cnidarians live in close relation with algeae from the genus symbiodinium 
- This relation between the two bring advantages to both entity, corals bring nutrients to the algal symbiont in a nutrient-poor water and the algea provide the coral with the product of the photosynthesis 
- but also with various other microorganism such as fungi, bacteria and archeae. 
- together with the microbiome, corals form a complex system called the holobiont
- 
- the family of symbiodiniaceae is divided within 9 different genera going from A to I wich can also be further divided in different subclade
- coral associate with six of them A-D and F and G 
- This relation between the two bring advantages to both entity, corals bring nutrients to the algal symbiont in a nutrient-poor water and the algea provide the coral with the product of the photosynthesis 
- coral also associate with variety of other microorganism such as bacteria, fungi and virus to form together with the host the holombiont. 

## The Bleaching problem 
 - As probably most of you may know, the reef are phasing more and more frequently a phenomenon called coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is the breakdown of the symbiosis and the expulsion of the symbiont out of the host. This  can be cause by diffent environmental change such as a high light intensity, a low waterflow a change in salinity or a change in temperature. 
- Different mecanism are used by the corals to adapt to those different stress and avoid bleaching. 
	- change in the microbiome (symbiont shifting) For example a coral dominated by clade C Could change its community for a Clade D dominance that is known to have a better tolerance to temperature change. However since the this Clade D is not its clade of predilection, it may have some side effects such as a slower growth for example. 
	- feeding strategy (from heterotrophy to autotrophy)
	- change in morphology (exposed to high waterfall can devloppe bigger and ticker branch)
	- change in gene expression that is mainly governed by epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation, Histone modification or Non-coding RNA. 

epigenetic studies on coral is a pretty novel field of study when it comes to corals and will be the main focus of this project. 

epigenomics mechanism has shown strong influence when it comes to adaptation but the dynamic to wish those adaptation comes and goes is widely unknown 
## Goal of the project 
Do previous environmental variations impact the resilience of corals to future temperature changes?

the Goal of the project are: 
- Study the impact of long-term and short-term environmental changes on the DNA methylation, transcriptome, microbiome, and morphology of corals.
- Measure the impact of previous environmental variations on the resilience to future short-term temperature stress.
## Ismuth of panama 
to complete this project, i will use the seasonal upwelling that happen in the pacific coast of Panama. 

the Pacific side of panama is divided into 2 main areas, the non-upwelling Gulf of chiriqui and the upwelling Gulf of panama.

The golf of Panama Is subject to a seasonal upwelling from January to may making the temperature vary from 30 to 25 degree while the golf chiruiqui is not influenced as much.

this upwelling will allow to induce relatively long environmental variation without having the need of using a mesocosm and will also allow me to keep the coral in their natural habitat 

## Pocillopora 
We will use 2 different species wich are the main reef builders in the pacific coast of Panama. 
- Pocillopora Meandrina 
- Pocillopora Verrucosa 

- _Pocillopora spp._ is the main reef builder on the Pacific coast of Panama.
- Both species are present in Coiba and Las Perlas
## Methodology 
## Panama 
the project will be carried out with the assistance of the smithsonian tropical research institute in Panama and their facilities in NAOS, Coiba and Las Perlas. 
### WP1
The first workpackage will consist of studying the impact of long-term environmental change on corals. 

for this 6 colonies of each species will be collected in las perlas and in Coiba for a total of 12 colonies for each zones. 
The methylation, the transcriptome and the microbiome will then be measured
### WP2
the second workpackage will consist of a crosstransplantation between the 2 zone. for this 6 fragments of the same colonies as WP1 will be at crosstransplanted between the 2 zone. 6 fragments of each colonies will also be transplanted into their original location to serve as a negative control. 
this workapackage will give us an insight on the impact of short term environmental change on coral gene expression microbiome and morphology. It will also give us an insight of the wash-out dynamics of those adaptation by tranplanting corals from las perlas to the non upwelling zone of coiba. 
after a year, the transplanted corals will be sampled and the methylation, transcriptome, microbiome and morphology will be measured. 
### WP3

for the last workpackage. tranplanted corals will be put under a short termal stress to mesure their resilience to temperture change after short and long environmental change. 
1 week cold and heat stress will be set as well as a control where the temperature wont change 

the stress will be set as the figure at the left. 

the mesocosm consist of 3 tub in wich 8 aquariums will be placed.here we can see the representation of one back.

each aquarium will contain 3 replicate of each colonie of one species for each environmental variation condition. 

each tub will have a different condition. One will exert a heat stress, one other will exert a cold stress and on other will be the control so no stress will be applied.  

the stress will last for a week where the temperature will be augmented for a the heat stress and lowered by 1 degree for the cold stress each day until reaching the desired 

temperature. the stress will then be helded for 3 days for a total of 7 days of stress. the control will remain at the normal temperature of 28°C 
## Analysis 
to fit into the 10 minutes timeline, i will briefly explain the measruement that will be evualuated on the sample obtained trough the different package. 

| workpackage | samples                                                            | measurement                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| WP1         | long term adaptation                                               | DNA methylation/transcriptome/microbiome            |
| WP2         | short term adapation                                               | DNA methylation/transcriptome/microbiome/morphology |
| WP3         | resilience to heat stress post long term and short term adaptation |                                                    |

- [x] Sophie: what do you think could go wrong? ✅ 2023-10-18
	the transplantation
- [x] How will you proceed with the transplantation, take corals for La Perlas, go to mesocosm in the Smithsonian, then go to Coimba ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] !! the controls need to go into the mesocosm as well ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] Why these two species? Most abundant -> evologically relevant + difference in bleaching ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] Why these two places? Why not Hawaii or Australia? Check whether upwelling also occurs in other places ✅ 2023-10-18
	seasonal upwelling also happen in other places such as colombia mexico costa rica and the gulf of california but also in south africa and north of madagascar  [[chollettUpwellingAreasNot2010a#^94948f]] but i am chossing this place because i have a knowledge of the field since i have been working ther for a week and know their ability to realise this project.
- [ ] Hugo: need to state whether you are looking at resilience or at plasticity adaptation or acclimatization?
- [ ] Put a slide with the definition of resilience and other key concepts
- [x] Previous -> past changes ✅ 2023-10-16
- [x] Methylation, transcriptome, microbiome, morphology: which one will you drop in case time or money is limited ✅ 2023-10-18
	microbiome as i am focusing on methylation, morphology won't cost any money so it won't be a problem 
- [x] What do you want to measure first? ✅ 2023-10-18
	the methylation
- [x] Show the sexy machines (3D scanner, nanopore) ✅ 2023-10-18
- [x] Why 6 colonies, and not more or less? ✅ 2023-10-18
	not more because of the capacity of the boat to perform the crosstransplantation. the corals has to be carried using a oxygenated tank.
- [x] Why not make long-term experiment in the mesocosm? ✅ 2023-10-18
	because the mesocosm is not infallible. problem can occur such as power outage (already happened) or failure of the heater or cooler. the shortest the use of the mesocosm, the less probability it is to encounter those problem. 
- [x] The methodology in WP1 and WP2 is similar, why did you do two WPs? ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] Existing study on the stress of transplantation? ✅ 2023-10-18
	it's not the first crostransplantation done in the world but it is the first one done between the non upwelling and upwelling season in panama 
- [x] Add keywords to each workpackage on your slides (instead of just WP1, WP2, WP3) so that it's clear to everyone ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] Why just 6? Crown-of-thorn could come and destroy your entire WP? Why not 6 more as backup? ✅ 2023-10-18
	there is the limitation of the boat, the corals as the be carried using a oxygenated tank and has to be carried together the same day, so there is a limit on how much corals we can bring 
- [ ] How big are the colonies? How do you attach them?
- [x] Claire: How did you choose the timing of your WP3 experiment? ✅ 2023-10-27
- [x] Be assertive in your answers (not like "most papers..." but "the papers") ✅ 2023-10-18
- [x] diving? Do everything in snorkel? ✅ 2023-10-16
	The field work will be done by snorkling as the reef are very shallow but to make the field work more fluid i will pass my scientific diving licence before leaving to Panama. 

- [x] correlation with physiological measurements? photosynthesis (diving PAM for instance)just use pictures for monitoring bleaching in the field, PAM in the mesocosm ✅ 2023-10-16
	i will use PAM for the short term thermal stress but can't use it for the field work as not everyone is formed to use this device so i will prefer to remain on photography than having poor data 
	
- [ ] what are you going to measure for methylation? How will you analyse your data? same for transc
- [ ] riptome?

- [ ] How will you find the genes in your data?
- [x] look for what your comitee is doing ✅ 2023-10-28
- [ ] look for what is an OTU for microbio 


- [ ] study the crossgenerational and intergenerational acclimatization and their effect on the DNA methylation, transcriptome microbiome and morphology 


- [x] “Can occure” misspelling to correct! ✅ 2023-10-31
 - [ ] “Mois: March 2023” should be “Month: March 2023” etc.
- [ ] The microbiome will be measured” ça ne marche pas comme manière de dire, ce serait plutôt “will be investigated” ou “will be documented"
