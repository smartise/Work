Dear STRI Community:

The Office of Academic Programs is hosting its highly anticipated Fellows’ Symposium on **Tuesday, June 27, 2023**. The symposium is a celebration of STRI’s Fellowship and Internship Programs and, similar to the previous years, it will be a mix of short talks and posters and will culminate with a barbeque!

All **current** STRI Fellows and Interns are encouraged to participate.  Those interested send title and a short abstract (150 words) to [bilgrayA@si.edu](mailto:bilgrayA@si.edu) by **J****une 1**.  Also – Important - please indicate if you would prefer to give a talk or present poster. 

Even if you will not be presenting, plan to attend and support your friends and colleagues!

**_Pocillopora spp_** **Symbiodiniaceae assemblage variation with temperature and salinity fluctuations across the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) of Panama**

The Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) of Panama has a unique oceanographic feature. It is composed of 2 gulfs: the Gulf of Chiriqui and the Gulf of Panama. Due to the different topography along the Isthmus of Panama, the former is not influenced by seasonal upwelling while the latter is. This seasonal upwelling induces a great variation in terms of salinity and temperature. Corals from the species Pocillopora spp live within those 2 gulfs, but due to this constant change of conditions, some evidence suggests that the reef populations from the Gulf of Panama are better able to endure bleaching events than the reefs from the Gulf of Chiriqui. Coral associations with Symbiodiniaceae can vary in response to environmental variation. Whether Pocillopora spp host Symbiodiniaceae varies during the season is currently unknown and could provide clues on the resistance mechanisms to environmental stress.
