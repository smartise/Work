title:  **_Pocillopora spp_** **Symbiodiniaceae assemblage variation with temperature and salinity fluctuations across the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) of Panama**



# introduction 
## Quick introduction of corals biology 
- They are symbiotic organism that live in close relation with algeae from the genus symbiodinium 
- Those symbiodinium are divided in different clade from H to D and depending on the coral species, the clade are more less specific to the corals 
- they provide goods for each other 

## Bleaching
- this close relation ship is the key for their sucess but also make them more sensitive to environmental variation
- This sensitivity is broadly linked to the production of reactive oxygen species by both the host and the symbiont 
- to avoid the toxicity of those ROS the corals break the symbiosis and becomes withe (bleached)
- the symbiont doesn't have the same sensitivity to stress some are more tolerable than other 
- exemple of clade D

## Symbiont shifting  
- some studies shows that some coral are able to shift symbionts to adapt to their environment 
- show papers 

## upwelling of the Ismuth of panama
- talk about the change in salinity and temperature during the different season
- talk about the reefs that are present to different site but from the same species 

## Step of the project 
- field work in las perlas and coiba 
- sequencing the taxonomy 
- sequencing ITS2 for the symbiodiniaceae community

# Introduction 

Corals are symbiotic Cnidarians that are in obligate symbioses with photosynthetic dinoflagellates from the familiy of Symbiodiniaceae  [[lajeunesseHostSymbiontRecombination2010]]. This relationship is strongly beneficial for both partners and is the key to the success of coral reefs. [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. the family of symbiodiniaceae is divided within 9 different genera going from A to I wich can also be further divided in different subclade [[cardenas-alvaradoHigherPopulationGenetic2021]],  [[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences]],
[[chenDiversitySymbiodiniaceae152019]]. coral associate with six of them A-D and F and G [[vanoppenBleachingResistanceRole2009]]. Depending on the species of the corals, the clade with wich the coral is in symbiosis vary and can be more or less specific. most of the time the coral is dominated by one clade but it's not rare to find a other clade at a lesser concentration [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012]].
Depending of the clade the coral is hosting, it may provide a greater stress tolerance to stress or more benefit during non-stressful conditions [[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences]]. 
This relation between the two bring advantages to both entity, corals bring nutrients to the algal symbiont in a nutrient-poor water and the algea provide the coral with the product of the photosynthesis [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]].


# Coral bleaching 

Many of you has probably heard of this term many time before as it is a great subject due the climate change. 
Coral bleaching is deffined as the loss of symbiont or pigment from the symbiont due to environmental stress [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012]]. The mecanism of this phenomenon is still debated but is widely linked to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the host and the symbiont but mostly by the symbiont. This overproduction con be conteract this production by producing antioxidant defenses, but when the stress is too great to avoid cellular damage, the host has no other choice than to break the symbiosis [[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021]], leaving the coral colorless and severly weakened.  
The sensitivity of corals to bleaching mostly come from the environment factor such as light intensity (due to depth, turbidity, cloud), water flow (allow them to remove more efficiently cellular toxin) and temperature. 
But sensistivity can also come from the coral itself. Some corals are more suspected to bleaching than other. For example corals with darker pigment tend to absorb more heat the light and are therefore more sensible to bleaching [[bakerClimateChangeCoral2008]]. Or if the coral host more thermal resistant symbiodiniaceae. 

# Symbiontshifting 

some corals in some circumstances can increase their thermal tolerance by changing the symbiont type that dominate their tissus (from C to D for example) [[berkelmansRoleZooxanthellaeThermal2006]] [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012]].

apparently the reduction of salinity would go toward a lineage of clade c [[weeEffectsTemperatureSalinity2021]]

# isthmus of Panama 
Panama has very unique feature when it comes water temperature and salinity. the Pacific side of panama is divided into 2 main areas, the non-upwelling Gulf of chiriqui and the upwelling Gulf of panama [[dcrozVariabilityUpwellingPacific2007]]. Each year, the gulf of Panama is subject to a seasonal upwelling [[randallUpwellingBuffersClimate2020]]. This upwelling induce great change in temperature (by up to 10 Â°C) and salinity over a short period of time (from december to mid april). corals in this area are slower-growing corals that are adapted to this seasonal changes. wether or not the corals from this area change it's symbiodiniaceae community according to the upwelling season is actually unknown and it could provide clues of the mechanism of adaptation to environmental stress.

# The Goal of the project 

- indentify the symbiodiniaceae clades in association with pocillopora.sp 
- determine the differences in symbiodiniaceae communities between corals from the golf of chiriqui and gulf of panama and acroos upwelling, non-upwelling and wet season 
- and with in colonies 

# Methodology 

library metabarcoding 
180 colonies previously tagged of Pocillopora spp were collected in 6 sites. 3 in las perlas (mogomogo, contadora, saboga) and 3 in coiba (granito de oro, canales, machete). 3 replicate (to check intracolonies variation) were made for each colonie sampled for a total of 540 of samples. 

DNA were extracted from each sample.  
the first step were to determine to wich species of pocillopora belong (verrucosa or meandrina/grandis) (varrucosa is more C dominated so to not mislead into a shifting of symbio commu while is just a different species [[cardenas-alvaradoHigherPopulationGenetic2021]]) . for this the mitochondrial open reading frame were sequenced to delineate the coral species. 

next we used the same extract DNA to sequence the symbiodiniacea community that lives within the coral tissu. for this the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) was sequenced from each extract

Then indexed using ... primers. the sequence obtained will then be integrated into a website called symportal.

# Symportal 
![[greyscale_alt1.svg]]
after the index, the samples are sequenced and the rough sequence is incoded into Symportal. symportal is analatycal framework to resolve genetically algal symbiont by using data from next generation sequencing. 

i will try my best to explain how it works but it's a very complicated system that works based on algorithme and database. 
ITS2 is one of the most popular gene when it comes to assesing the symbiodiniaceae diversity. 
ITS2 gene is a multicopy marker, meaning that a single symbiodiniaceae contain thousands of gene copies. and there is sequence variation between those copy (intregenomic varitaiton) 
however there is also variation of this gene between different genotypes of symbiodiniaceae called intergenomic variation 

symportal use specific combinations of intragenomic variation called "defining intragenomic variant" to find those, the program search for sequence that reoccur in a sufficient number of sample. those sequence are called DIVs and since they are the same for a majority of the sample they are considered intragenomic variation. the ITS2 profile is then determine using the charachterisation as well as the abundance of the DIVs. for that with in each sample, the algorithme also do a multimodal distribution analysis. by doing this it is possible to differ ITS2 type profile that has the same DIVs but not at the same abundance

if you have any question or modification you think i should do, i' open to critics. 

## how symbiodiniacea community work 




# Expected result 

coral from the pocillopora genre is know to be in symbiosis with both clade C and D [[glynnEnvironmentalGeographicalFactors2023]]. The ratio between the 2 is also shown to change depending on the stress [[glynnEnvironmentalGeographicalFactors2023]]. the suspected result are thus to see a shift from a dominance in C to D, as the clade D is more able to deal with thermal stress.
