coral reef resilience 
Endosymbiont community 
Genetic
  
I am a graduate master's student in oceanography from the University of Li√®ge (Belgium) who is fascinated by coral ecology.
i am currently studying the influence of upwelling on the Symbiodiniaceae community of the coral Pocillopora spp. I work particularly on identifying the endosymbiont community through sequencing and observing their dynamics throughout the upwelling and wet season of the Pacific coast of Panama.
