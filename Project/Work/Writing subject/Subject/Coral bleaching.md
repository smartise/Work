Coral bleaching is the loss of the symbiont from the coral holobiont. It is a complex mechanism that is still debated but is principally linked to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mostly by the endosymbiont, under stressfull condition [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. ROS mostly include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that can cause damage in various cell part such as membranes, DNA and proteins of both symbiont and host cells. To fight against those reagent, 
the host and the symbiont produce ROS scavenging compounds such as superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase. [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. But when the production of ROS exceed the detoxification rate, it result by a deterioration and a degradation of the holombiont [[marty-riveraMitigationCoralBleaching2018]]. The coral then expel the symbiont from the holombiont to prevent extensive damage that would lead the the organisms death.
