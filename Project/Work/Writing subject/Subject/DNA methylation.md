# introduction 
DNA methylation is a biochemical event that exist in many different organism and take part in many biological process. It manifest it's effect by enhancing or reducing the affinity between the protein and the DNA [[adusumalliMethodologicalAspectsWholegenome2015#^8b9227]] [[liuDetectionDNABase2019#^b1207f]]. It is also the easiest to measure and the most studied epigenetic mechanism [[dixonBenchmarkingDNAMethylation2021#^16c8ff]]
DNA methylation occur mostly on cytosine followed by a guanine (CG dinucleotide) also called CpG methylation. the methylation is induce by the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmetionine to the the fiffth carbon of the pyrmidine ring to become 5-methylcytosine. This reaction is induce by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2019]] [[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017#^1015b2]][[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^1dcfb1]]. 

DNMTs is a group of enzyme that include DNMT3a, DNMT3b and DNMT1. DNMT3a and DNMT3b plays a role in establishing DNA methylation while DNMT1 maintain the methylation patten with the genome [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2019]], [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^e6aa67]].
The impact of gene body methylation on gene expression is still under debate, some studies propose the theory that GBM reduce the the expression of the gene [[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017#^7dd962]], [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^13e932]], while other scientist believed that GBM is simply accumulated in highly transcripted chromatine [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^13e932]]. Methylation can also happen in other location than CpG dinucleotides (non-CpG methylation) including methylation at cytosine but followed by other nucleotide such as adenine, thymine or another cytosine [[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017]]. It can also happen on other base such as adenine to form N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6ma) and other groupment can also be added such as hydroxymethyl (to form with cytosine 5-hydroxymethylcytosine or 5hmC)[[liuDetectionDNABase2019#^0d14e6]]. There is 42 different DNA modification to this day) but the cytosine remain the most commun [DNAmod: Home](https://dnamod.hoffmanlab.org/)

## Demethylation 
DNA methylation is not permanent and 5mC can also be demethylated via 2 ways: 
- passive DNA demethylation 
- active DNA demethylation 
[[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017]]
[[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2019]]
Passive DNA demethylation occure due to DNA synthesis without the occurenc of new methylation. when DNA is replicated, the methylation is not copied and has to be raplied each time the DNA is duplicated. [[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017]]
[[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2019]]
Active DNA demethylation is induce by enzyme via deamination or oxidation of the cytosine. it is carried by *ten eleven translocation protein (TET)* that oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. These components can then be futher broken down through thymine-mediated excision and base excision repair to unmethylated cytosine. During the demethylation process there is also a small percent of change that the cytosine mutate to a thymine inducing base change. This mutation can then be corrected later on by *base excision repair* [[jangCpGNonCpGMethylation2017]]
[[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2019]], [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^f527f0]]. This process is however not effeicient at 100% and thus leave a signature of consistent historical methylation allowing the detection of methylated gene just through classical sequencing [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^13688c]]

# Methylation in corals 
In mammals, the great majority of CpG dinucleotide are methylated (70-80%) with the exception of long rich CpG sequence called CpG islands (CGIs). However in particular situation, CGIs can be targetted by methylation and depending of their proximity to a transcription starting site (TSS), it can inhibit its transcription to a certain extend . [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014#^80a1c9]]

In inverterbrate, methylation is less ubiquitous and happen specifically on CpG that are present within the gene bodies (called transcription units). It is also occurs principally on exons rather than intron [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014#^22af3f]].

Gene involve in basic biological function with a similar regulation between the different tissus such as nucleic acid metabolism or cellular metbaolic processes tend to be highly metilated [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]]. on the other hand, gene that are differently regulated between tissus and devlopmental stages such as cell-cell signaling or devlopment tend to be less methylated. Strong methylation is synonyme of stability whyle weak methylation is synonyme for flexibility [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^76abc6]]. This bimodal methylation configuration remain consitent in many different invertebrate taxa including cnidarians [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]][[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^4119f5]]. 


DNA methylation processes in reef building corals is influence by environmental change [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]
# Methylation and environmental stress 
GBM change greatly due to environmental change [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^5f0804]] [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^6da12c]]. it has been shown that by transplanting coral from a stable environment to a more unstable environment, the disparity between highly methylated gene and low methylated gene become less significant. The highly methylated gene become less methylated and the low methylated gene become more methylated. The opposit phenomenon is also visible when corals from a variable environment is transplanted to a more stable environment. This change, also called "seasaw" pattern, is however not observed in intergenic region [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^54be00]], [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^e295f8]] . However the extend of this change have shown great difference between taxa [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^196f26]]

# transgenerational 

GBM is believed to be to a certain extend heritable as the sequestration of the germ cells is though to be lacking in cnidarians.[[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^5f0804]], [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^fb21e7]], [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^5d889f]], [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^23b295]] [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^ccdb2c]]. Some corals can also reproduce assexually allowing the inheritence of DNA methylation to their offspring [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^23b295]].
DNA methylation can also be transmitted from adult to their sperm and larvae as genotype indepedent adjustement of methylation in stress-related gene were strongly linked to the survival of their offspring during heat stress (*sexuel ou asexuel ?*)[[liewIntergenerationalEpigeneticInheritance2020#^591da8]][[liewIntergenerationalEpigeneticInheritance2020#^40ce74]] [[liewIntergenerationalEpigeneticInheritance2020#^883581]].
