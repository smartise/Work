# introduction
Epigenetic represent mechanism that structure phenotypic variation via genotype-environment interactions [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]].
Some authors even extend this definition by including the community of microbes associated with the organism because microbial symbiotn are able to influence the host phenotype [[vanoppenBuildingCoralReef2015]].
# Epigenetic and acclimatation 
Environmental epigenetic is a recent growing field and focus on the study of the cause-effect relationship between enxposure to environmental stressors, the modifications to the epigenetic states and the change it induce to the phenotypes of the organisms [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]]. Sessil organisms such as plants and corals, as they are sessile organisms, can not migrate in other location when the environmental conditions are not optimal. Those organism has the obligation to have a great environmental adaptation when it comes to environmental varitiation and is then believed to have a great epigenetic plasticity [[dixonBimodalSignaturesGermline2014]] [[vanoppenBuildingCoralReef2015]]. In corals, this plasticity is believed to have a great impact to acclimate to changes of their environment. [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]] [[cziesielskiPresentFutureCoral2019]] [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]]. Light and temperature stress is believed to enhance stress tolerance of previously impacted colonies, and this *environmental memory* may persist for decades [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]].


The main uncertainty when it comes to the impact of epigenetic mechanism in coral resilience is their wash-in, wash-out dynamics of thos addaptation [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]]. the magnitude, the type and especially the duration of those adaptation is barely known and need further investigation to better understand it's potential impact in the near futur [[eirin-lopezMarineEnvironmentalEpigenetics2018]].

# Mechanism
Epigenetic regulation include a variety of regulatory mechanism such as : 
- chromatin structure remodeling 
- histone modification 
- [[DNA methylation]] and [[ncRNA]]
Epigenetics mechanism regulate the gene expression at both, the transcription (histone modification and DNA methylation)and translation (ncRNA)

# transgenerational 



# concervation 

natural variation in DNA methylation and small RNAs among several plant species can remain stable for hundreds of years and the notion of using epigenetic mechanism to improve them is gaining interest [[vanoppenBuildingCoralReef2015]].
epigenetics and preconditioning could be a promising mechanism for coral adaptation and survival. however a greater understanding of these mechanism has to be achieved before being succesfully utilized [[cziesielskiPresentFutureCoral2019]]. different epigenotypes of coral acclimated to stressfull conditions could be developped and introduce back into their location for more a long-term reef restoration point of view [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020]].

when it comes to sexual reproduction, trasngeneration inheritance of epigenetic trait has been recorded in the branching oral species *Pocillopora damicornis* folowing the exposure of adults to acidificaiton stress. This "environmental memory" was then transferred to the offspring [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]].
