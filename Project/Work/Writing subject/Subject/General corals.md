coral reef are consider the rainforest of the sea, representing less than 0.1% of the Ocean but hosting aprroximatively one third of all marine species [[rinkevichAugmentingCoralAdaptation2021]] [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]] [[InterventionsHelpCoral]]. they are one of the richest ecosystem in the worlds that provide many ecosystem services and support the livelihoods an economic activities of many population. The prevent from costal erosion and support the life stage of many marine species [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]].
However, they are also among the most sensitive ecosystem to climate change [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]].
In those modern days, coral reef are subject to more and more chronic and acute anthropogenic disturbances such as poor water quality, destructive fishing practices, outbreak of coral desease and last but not least climate change [[bostrom-einarssonCoralRestorationSystematic2020]]. The earth is facing a rapid global warming driven by the over production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases inducing a fast rise of global temperature when compared with historical redord [[tremblayHeterotrophyPromotesReestablishment2016]]. All those change are outpacing the rate in which coral can naturally adapt leading in the past decades to the loss of more than 40% of the world's coral reefs and 75% of the remaining reef are highly threatened [[vanoppenShiftingParadigmsRestoration2017]] [[johnsonCaribbeanAcroporaRestoration]].
