# Symbiosis 
Corals live in obligate symbiosis with algeae of the genus Symbiodinium. This symbiosis is beneficial for both partner as the symbiodinium provide over 90% of the energy requirement to the host and the host provide protection and nutrient to the algeae [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018#^94d3ce]]. This symbiosis is the key to coral reef success but is also on of the reason for their great sensibility to environmental change [[davyCellBiologyCnidarianDinoflagellate2012#^2525ea]].
