# Introduction
metazoans such as coral host a great variety of different microorganisms such as dinoflagellates, fungi, bacteria, archeae and viruses that play an important function in the organism that affect their physiology, stress tolerence and fitness [[pradaLinkingPhotoacclimationResponses2022#^171979]] [[zieglerBacterialCommunityDynamics2017#^13a124]] [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^712f18]] [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^29fa45]]. The community composition is strongly influenced by the coral species and reef location where same species can host different microbiome depending on their location giving them different resilience to environmental conditions [[epsteinTemporalVariationMicrobiome2019#^ea962c]] [[zieglerBacterialCommunityDynamics2017#^42223d]]. 


# Bacteria
compare to the very specific association between coral and symbiodiniaceae, bacterial community associated with corals are more diverse and evenly distributed [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^6a2d38]]. 

# symbiodiniaceae 
symbiodiniacea are dinoflagellates that are mostly endosymbiotic unicellular that associate with many marine invertebrate such as coral mollusks or sponges [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^bde358]]
the family of symbiodiniaceae is divided within 9 different genera also called clade going from A to I wich can also be further divided in different subclade (Symbiodinium = clade A, Breviolum = clade B, Cladocopium = clade C, Durusdinium = clade D, Effrenium = clade E, Fugacium = clade F, Gerakladium = clade G) [[cardenas-alvaradoHigherPopulationGenetic2021#^234d38]],  [[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences#^3fcbf5]]. 

## symbiosis

Corals associate with 6 of the symbiodiniaceae clades  A, B, C, D, F, and G but reef-buildings corals tend to associate more commonly with clade A-D [[vanoppenBleachingResistanceRole2009#^3c31e3]], 
[[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^2c10d4]]. 
Despite the different clades, corals seems to be dominated to one symbiodiniacea clade [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020]], but few coral species (25%) are able to associate with mulitple clades with the exception of scleratinan (stony corals) that seems to have the ability to affiliate with multiple clades [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^65ae22]], [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^160b68]]

The coral can acquire those symbiont through 2 different way: By ==the horizontal acquisition strategy== where the coral acquire the symbiont from the environment or ==by the vertical symbiont strategy== where the coral acquire its symbiotns from the parent colony [[statVariationSymbiodiniumITS22011#^86a828]].

The coral host protects the symbiont and provide its waste carbon and nitrogen as reefs are usually poor of those nutrients [[palmerCnidariaAnthozoansHot2018#^226586]] [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^b359b9]]




# Impact of the microbiome on environmental change resilience. 
In Corals, as much as in many other organism, this microbiome is not set and may vary depending of the host and the environment they live in [[zieglerBacterialCommunityDynamics2017]]. some coral species show a very stable microbial community through time [[epsteinTemporalVariationMicrobiome2019]]. when exposed to a change in environment, the microbiome adapat itself more or less importantly depending on the environment and the host [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012]][[zieglerBacterialCommunityDynamics2017]][[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^aba9b1]] [[rodriguez-casariegoGenomeWideDNAMethylation2020#^b388e6]].

# impact of the Symbiodiniaceae on environmental change resilience.
Symbiodinium has very different tollerance to environmental change and difference in symbiodiniaceae community hosted by the coral has been widely link to different response to environmental stress [[sampayoBleachingSusceptibilityMortality2008#^37b1da]]
[[humeSymPortalNovelAnalytical2019#^cdde9e]]

Difference in symbiodiniaceae tipe and symbiodiniaceae-coral symbiosis has been linked to different factor such as photophysiology of symbiodinium, growth rate of corals colonies, carbon fixation and translocation to the host, symbiont thermal tolerance and host disease susceptibility [[statVariationSymbiodiniumITS22011#^1cefbc]]
[[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences#^3f8017]]

For instance, 
Species from clade D and C tend to have a high resistance to high sedimentation, irradiance and temperature [[cardenas-alvaradoHigherPopulationGenetic2021#^a739bf]], but symbiont from clade D (such as D1 and $D1_{a}$) is known to have a particulary high tolerence to cold and heat stress compare to other symbiodiniaceae clades. Corals that host them tend to be more resistant to such stress [[cunningFlexibleAssociationsPocillopora2013]] [[randallAssessingRoleHistorical2020]] [[sampayoBleachingSusceptibilityMortality2008#^dacc56]][[marangoniSymbiontRegulationStylophora2021#^f79992]], [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^1c41a0]], [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^16acfa]]
[[jonesBioticAbioticInfluences#^592d72]]
Under severe environmental change, Corals are able to switch to more appropriate symbiodiniacea to better fit their new environment [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020]] [[epsteinTemporalVariationMicrobiome2019#^9c7d26]].
[[berkelmansRoleZooxanthellaeThermal2006#^c86920]]
[[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^2ff151]]. However, it is believed that this tipe of acclimatization is not feasible for most of the coral species as the vast majority of corals are 'symbiotic specialist'. It is especially true for scleratinian corals as they rarely associate with thermally tolerant symbiodinium such as clade D [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^616159]], [[silversteinSpecificityRarelyAbsolute2012#^634f92]].

When it comes to change in symbiodiniaceae community, there is 2 theory on how this occure: ==the adapative bleaching hypothesis (ABH)== which states that coral bleaching allows the corals to assciate with different symbionts when regaining them and ==the coral probiotic hypothesis (CPH)== which indicates that there is a dynamic relationship between the microbiome the host and the environmental condition. There is, to date, no evidence on which hypothesis is valid as well as how much time it last .[[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^bbb2d9]][[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^9591ab]].[[sampayoBleachingSusceptibilityMortality2008#^ca88bd]] [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^9fef8d]]


There is also the question on where does the symbiodiniaceae come from. some study suggest that the new symbiodiniaceae community was not taken from the environment but rather already present within the host's tissues. These tollerent zooxanthellae then overtake the host's tissu after the bleaching event [[berkelmansRoleZooxanthellaeThermal2006#^b2c42e]], [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^dfef2d]]
