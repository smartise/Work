# intro 
stony corals (scleratinians) can present a large variety of shape (branching, corymbose, digitate, encrusting, laminar or massive) [[kramerCoralMorphologyPortrays2020#^84f4ae]]. Those different shapes are manly linked to the species of the corals but one species of corals can show different shapes aso called morphospecies [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015]]. This change of morphology has for long confuse scientist as they were using morphology to determine coral species. Some survey were observing some species in one year to be absent the year after [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015]][[dimondGeneticEpigeneticInsight2017#^5d341d]], [[dimondGeneticEpigeneticInsight2017#^1bc2b5]]. Genetic data has also allowed the discovery of cryptic species (species that show the same morphology but are genetically distinct) among similar morphotypes that were believed to be one single species [[dimondGeneticEpigeneticInsight2017#^7f139e]]

The mechanism of morphospecies change is still widely unknown but are believed to depend on the environment and the genetic species of the coral [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015]] [[zawadaQuantifyingCoralMorphology2019]]. Light is the most influent foctor influencing coral morphology but other factor such as waterflow and nutrient has also shown significant impact [[zawadaQuantifyingCoralMorphology2019]] [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^2d1f16]], [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^147e12]][[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^db7d26]]. light has been shown to induce branching in corals while flow lead to the devloppment of more thicker branches [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^0d6dd6]], [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^3047f2]]. However our knowledge on how coral morphology react to different environmental change remain poor [[toddMorphologicalPlasticityScleractinian2008a#^185b01]]. Thise change in morphology can be really fast as some corals (*P.darmicornis, P. inflata*) that had change in morphology due to an environmental change (storm) came back to their original shape in less than 6-8 month [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^a1e6f6]], [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^d8f91c]], [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^076a8b]].
