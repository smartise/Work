# Pocillopora 
in the pacific ocean of panama, Pocillopora is the main constructor of fringing reef [[glynnPacificCoralReefs#^10e65e]], [[glynnPacificCoralReefs#^d61c17]] [[cunningFlexibleAssociationsPocillopora2013]] [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^7a81ba]]. it is ones believed that it would be one of the first coral genera to dissapear to climate change due to there tendency to bleach du to environmental change [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^8e6eb6]].

# Morphospecies in Panama 
The Pacific side of Panama posess 7 different described Pocillopora morphospecies (P.capitata, P.damicornis, P.elegans, P.eydouxi, P.inflata, P.meandrina, P.verrucosa). The most commun being P.damicornis, P.elegans, P.capitata and P.verrucosa [[glynnBiogeographicAnalysisReview]]. However those affirmation are not always true as pocillopora coral show a high morphological plasticity (especially in the highly variable environment of the ETP) that can induce a change in species proportion in less than a year [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^bcb31f]]. For instance P.damicornis has been shown to change to P.inflata following the succesion of repetitive storm and returning to their initial morphology of P.damicornis after the storm event [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^32d11c]], [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^a1e6f6]]. P.inflata is a morphotype that happen to be a response to storm event [[paz-garciaSwitchMorphospeciesPocillopora2015#^387fef]]

# Pocillopora verrucosa 
[Corals of the World](http://www.coralsoftheworld.org/species_factsheets/species_factsheet_summary/pocillopora-verrucosa/)
pocillopora verrucosa form thick and compact branches in exposed habitat and is more open and thiner on protected area. it has a pink/brown color and live in most shallow water environments from exposed reefs fronts to protected fringing reefs.

# Pocillopora meandrina 

Colonies are small upright bushes. Branches radiate from the initial point of growth. They are flattened, those in shallow water being curved when viewed from above. Verrucae are neat and uniform.

**Colour:** Usually cream, green or pink.

**Habitat:** Shallow reef environments.

# Microbiome 

## Bacteria 
coral from the genera pocillopora tend to have a very stable microbiome trough time compare to other genera such as acropora [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^4f96ea]], [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^6a2d38]]. Moreover species of Pocillopora such as P.verrucosa is also dominated by one single taxa of bacteria, *Endozoicomonas*.[[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^dd5f50]]. This is also believed to be one of the reason why bacterial commuvnity is so stable as the dominant taxa exerce a stabilizing effect on the other taxa composing the microbiome [[voolstraAdaptingMicrobialHelp2020#^8e9944]].

## symbiodiniaceae 
pocillopora host different tipes of symbiodiniacea clades mainly clade D and C (especially C1b-c and D1) depending on the species and the place they live in [[torresZooxanthellaeDiversityCoralSymbiont2021#^b851b2]]
