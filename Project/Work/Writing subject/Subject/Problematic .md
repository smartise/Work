Despite our best effort, reefs will undergo drastic change due to futur environmental change [[anthonyInterventionsHelpCoral2020]]. Many researcher are actively investigating different method that could be use to increase coral thermal tolerance, in particular reef-building corals: 
- manipulation of the host's microbiome to a more thermal tolerant microbiom (symbiont shifting)
- evolution of cultured symbiodinium under elevated temperature and acididty followed by an inoculation of coral hosts with the evolved algal cultures
- selective breeding of the coral host 
- preconditioning or epigenetic programming

The epigenetic mechansim that are invovled in enhancing the resilience on corals is still widely unknown [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020#^7a2a79]] [[cziesielskiPresentFutureCoral2019#^dc6ef9]].
