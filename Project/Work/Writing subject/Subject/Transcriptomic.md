# Tanscriptomic and methylation 
DNA methylation is linked to transcriptional plasticity wich influence the response to stressor [[cziesielskiPresentFutureCoral2019#^b3829b]]. Methylated gene has a greatly reduce transcriptional variability [[clevesUnknownKnownAdvancing2020#^9c8251]].


# Gene expression in stress 

Gene expression greatly change due to environmental variation. When exposed to environmental variation such as lower quality habitat, Corals has been shown to up-regulate the gene involved in environmental response while house-keeping genes are downregulated [[dixonRoleGeneBody2018#^9261d5]].

This gene expression plasticity has also been shown to influence greatly the response to corals to environmental change and high gene epxression plasticity is believed to be link to a lower susceptibility to bleaching during environmental change [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016#^c369b0]], [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016#^d0e157]]. This gene expression plasticity can also vary depending on the environment where the coral live. Corals living in more unstable environment has been shown to have a greater geneexpression plasticity compare to the one living in more stable area [[kenkelGeneExpressionPlasticity2016#^deaaea]]

environmental change has been shown to influence different coding loci of coral *porites astreoides* such as: 
- calciul-independent protein kinase C-like. this protein is involved in intracellular signaling. it is a process that is expressed by low methylated gene and that id believed to have a more variability in its expression [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^c271bd]]
- encoding gene for the putative tax1 binding protein homolgue. this protein is involve in the inhibition of the apoptoctic process by inhibiting the NF-kB transcription factor activity wich promote the symbiosis with the dynoflagellate. a high expression of this tax1 binding protein is thus associated with a inhibition of bleaching [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^0e0ae0]].
- encoding gene for U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. this protein is involve in mRNA splicing [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^94818a]]
- FAM98A protein. This protein is believed to be necessary for the expression of an arginine methyltransferase wich is a protein involved in the methylation of histone, an other epigenetic modification [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^1526a3]].
- there is also the change in epxression of non-coding RNA. Those ncRNA are believed to play a role in post-transcriptional mRNA silencing or are also involved in in directing DNA and histone methylation patern [[dimondConvergenceDNAMethylation2019#^2b90bd]]
- The gene expression has been shown to be influenced by change in environmental condition such as gene involved in cell signaling, heat-shoch protein response, and those acting as molecular chaperones [[putnamOceanAcidificationInfluences2016a#^4b3aae]].
