# introduction 
# The ETP of Panama 
The Eastern tropical pacific is an Oceanographic zone that is home of one of the most isolated and resilient coral reef in the world. the ETP is defined by extreme temperature, nutrient and salinity change induce by different phenomenon such as tropical heavy rain, upwellings and el Nino event [[randallUpwellingBuffersClimate2020]].

The Pacific coast of Panama is divided into 2 main zones the golf of panama in the east and the golf of chiriqui in the west. Due to the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ) (The ITCZ are areas of low pressure around the equator where trades winds converge), it's annual migration and the topographic difference along the isthmus of Panama, the 2 zone have very distinct environment.

During the boreal winter from December to mid-april, the ITCZ migrate south of the ismuth of Panaman, strengening the northeat trade winds across the region. this change in wind pattern induce an Ekman transport and force surface water offshore bringing cold and nutrient rish water from below above the surface (upwelling).

however due to the topographic difference along the ismuth of Panama in particular due to the central cordillera to the west and the low in the cordillera to the east, the trade winds are inhibited in the west. The golf of chiriqui is thus less exposed to trade winds reducing significantly the upwelling effect compared to the Golf of Panama.

to resume, the pacific coast of Panama is divided into 2 main zone, the upwelling golf of Panama and the non-upwelling golf of chiruiqui [[dcrozVariabilityUpwellingPacific2007]]. 

# The Upwelling and it's impact 
the seasonal upwelling in the golf of Panama start in january and end in may. such wind-driven upwelling induce a drop of temperature of up to 10 degrees within a very short amount of time of few days to weeks [[randallUpwellingBuffersClimate2020]]. 

# lattitude and longitude of panama 

lattitude = 4 -10 °N 
longitude = -84 - -77 °W
longitude = 276 - 283 °E

distance between teh 2 iland = 300 km 
# Pacific Coral reef

in the pacific coast of Panama, the main scleratinian reef-builders are pocillopora, pavona and porites [[glynnPacificCoralReefs]].but pocillopora remain the primary builder in the ETP [[cunningFlexibleAssociationsPocillopora2013]]
