title : Research for an Internship Olivier Collard September 2022-2023

Dear <% tp.file.title%>, 

My name is Olivier Collard, and I'm currently a student in my second year of a Master’s degree in oceanography at the University of Liège in Belgium. I am currently doing my master’s thesis at the  
Genetics and physiology of microalgae lab (University of Liege) where I am working on the response to hyperthermic stress on the bioenergetics factors of stylophora pistillata.

My university recently promoted an Erasmus+ program allowing students to do an internship abroad after their master's thesis. this program would be for a period of 1 year and gives me access to a scholarship to meet all my daily expenses, the internship should therefore not be remunerated.

Given my deep interest in your research  and my desire to learn more about your field of expertise, I would love to do this internship with you.

If you need any references,
you can contact the promotor of my master's thesis Pierre Cardol 
Pierre.Cardol@uliege.be

or Stephane Roberty 
sroberty@uliege.be

I am available to provide you with any further information you may require.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards 

Olivier collard
